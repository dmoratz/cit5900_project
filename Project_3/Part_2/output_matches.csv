1410.0,Completed,The Effects of Adjustment Costs on Market Competition,Chicago,2015.0,2018.0,German Bet,Vulnerable Jobs and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,article,published,2019.0,58,3,484-521,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12240,Vulnerable Jobs and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,"Do job characteristics modulate the relationship between import competition and workers’ wages? Using pooled cross‐sectional, linked employee‐establishment Census Bureau microdata and O* NET occupational characteristics, the paper models import competition and wages for more than 1.6 million individuals, grouped by job vulnerability defined by routineness, analytic complexity, and interpersonal interaction. Results show import competition is associated with wages that are: lower in routine and less complex jobs; higher in nonroutine and complex jobs; and higher for the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal interaction. This demonstrates the importance of accounting for occupational characteristics in understanding how trade and wages relate.",2019,2019-06-10,1,Abigail M. Cooke; Thomas Kemeny; David L.

The 2010 Census Match Study and American Community Survey (ACS) Match Study represent recent efforts by the Census Bureau to evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on persons and addresses in the 2010 Census and 2010 ACS. The 2010 Census Match Study also examines demographic response data collected in administrative records. Building on this analysis, we match data from the 2010 ACS to federal administrative records and third party data as well as to previous census data and examine administrative records coverage and agreement of ACS age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin responses. We find high levels of coverage and agreement for sex and age responses and variable coverage and agreement across race and Hispanic origin groups. These results are similar to findings from the 2010 Census Match Study.",2017,2017-01-11,5,Adela Luque; Renuka Bhaskar; Sonya Rastogi; James Noon,,"Health disparities and outcomes; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Healthcare Policy and Management",,01,"Luque, Adela; Bhaskar, Renuka; Rastogi, Sonya; Noon, James. 2017.

We combine two rich data sources: 1) administrative employer-employee matched data from the US Census Bureau; and 2) firm-level information on the first large-scale H-1B visa lottery in 2007. Using an event-study approach, we find that lottery wins lead to increases in firm hiring of college- educated, immigrant labor along with increases in scale and productivity. Skill-intensive, high-paying firms expand the most after winning the H-1B lottery. We find limited evidence of displacement effects on native-born, college-educated workers.",2023,2023-01-01,14,Agostina Brinatti; Mingyu Chen; Parag Mahajan; Nicolas Morales; Kevin Shih,"University of Michigan; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; University of Delaware; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; Queens College, CUNY","Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Names, Identity, and Discrimination Research; Franchising Strategies and Performance",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Brinatti, Agostina; Chen, Mingyu; Mahajan, Parag; Morales, Nicolas; Shih, Kevin. 2023.

Such data retain utility for many types of broad analyses but can yield biased or insufficiently precise results in others. Research access to de-identied versions of the restricted-use data with little or no alteration is often possible, albeit costly and time-consuming. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of public-use and restricted-use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) in constructing a wage index. The public-use data used were Public Use Microdata Samples, while the restricted-use data were accessed via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data source and compare estimated CWIs and standard errors at the state and labor market levels. We find the results from the publicly available data are generally good relative to the restricted-use data, with greater similarity for larger areas and less similarity for smaller areas. Standard errors are higher in the public-used data but may still be underestimated.",2018,2018-12-24,1,Satkartar K. Kinney; Alan F.
