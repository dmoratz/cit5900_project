"The Impact of Foreign Trade on the U.S. Economy","The project will proceed in three phases. The first will enhance the export and import information on Economic Censuses and Surveys. We will develop and test linkages between transaction level Foreign Trade data and Economic Census and Survey data and compare the links developed by CES to those developed by the Census Bureau’s Foreign Trade Division (FTD). If improvements in linkages methods are identified, we will provide advice to FTD. The second phase will analyze transaction level detail to examine changes in foreign trade transactions, focusing initially on related party transactions, potential underreporting, and impact of FTD outreach efforts. This component of the project will focus on identifying reasons for such changes. The third phase of the project will develop empirical and analytical framework to investigate the impact of trade on the U.S. economy - focusing on how firms allocate economic activity between domestic and foreign production and the impact of this on the domestic economy (including workers and regional economies). This component makes use of the data developed in the previous phases to develop new estimates of the impact of foreign trade on U.S. industries. It will examine how imports and exports affect domestic production, employment, and productivity. It will also examine how firm responses to trade affect local labor market outcomes.","Entry, Expansion, and Intensity in the U.S. Export Boom, 1987-1992","Bernard, A.B. and Jensen, J.B.

"Do Plants Change Their Productivity and Wage Rankings?","Prior work using the LRD has demonstrated considerable plant-level heterogeneity in productivity (and, to a lesser extent, wages), and that much of this ""plant effect"" persists over time. This project examines those plants that experience large movement in their relative productivity, or in their relative wages, over the LRD time period. In particular, we wish to estimate the likelihood of sizeable (and consistent) movement in relative productivity or wages as a function of industry, plant size, firm size, sales growth, and geography (urban/rural, region). Besides estimating statistical models, we wish to construct a 5x5 tabulation of ""beginning-of-period quintile"" versus ""end-of-period quintile"" for productivity and for wages.","Wage and Productivity Stability in U.S. Manufacturing Plants","Long, Mark C., Kristin M.

"Explaining Home Bias in Consumption: Production Location, Magnification, and Hysteresis","Empirical studies of interregional trade in North America have found that trade within national borders exceeds trade across national borders by a factor of twenty.  This study proposes and tests explanations for why trade appears to be so dramatically reduced by national borders.  The chief hypothesis is that firms' location decisions endogenously create ""home bias"" in trade flows.  Additional implications of the model include magnification (measured border costs dramatically overstate true costs), hysteresis (measured border effects persist after actual costs drop to zero) and internal border effects (shipping patterns within a country exhibit discontinuities that mimic costs).  The paper suggests theoretical improvements on the standard ""gravity"" model of trade, and proposes empirical tests that can be used to assess the model, relative to the gravity model. We will use the Commodity Flow data to analyze two broad implications of this model.  One, are composition effects, ignored in the previous literature, critical for understanding measured border effects? Two, are the co-location decisions of intermediate and final goods producers the source of the composition effects?","Explaining Home Bias in Consumption: The Role of Intermediate Input Trade","Russell Hillberry & David Hummels, 2002.

"Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing.","Industrial energy demand typically involves base load consumption. As a result the industrial component of energy demand has important implications in evaluating energy infrastructure, i.e. oil, gas, electric power. There is growing concern that the energy infrastructure could be subject to both natural (e.g. storms or equipment failure) and manmade (e.g. terrorist) disruptions. To address the economic and human implications of such a disruption, planning agencies are taking a closer look at the energy infrastructure and its customers to assess its robustness and ability to continue vital functions as well as identify potential weaknesses. This project uses the LRD and MECS databases to estimate a distribution-company-level model of industrial energy demand for natural gas and electricity via a plant-level energy demand equation. An element unique to this study is the use of “establishment location” in a geographic information system (GIS) to create new, supplemental data on the relationship between the plant and the energy distribution system. These supplemental data are then used to improve the forecasting abilities of the econometric model. The benefits to the Census Bureau include 1) the creation of the GIS layers that can be used to access various data sources such as the LRD, MECS, and SSEL, in an intuitive visual mode which highlights spatial relationships, 2) the link across the LRD and MECS to create plant-level energy prices, and 3) the forecasting equations that can be used to impute non-response to energy questions in the ASM and MECS.","A method for measuring the efficiency gap between average and best practice energy use: The ENERGY STAR industrial energy performance indicator","Boyd, G.

"Trade, Employment, and Inequality: An Investigation of Rural Economic Change","The goal of this project is to improve the utility of Census Bureau data by providing new measures of the impacts of U.S. international manufacturing trade on employment, wages, and income inequality in rural (nonmetro) counties of the United States. The project involves two components: 1) regression analysis of the employment impacts of international trade on rural counties and 2) regression analysis of the impacts of international trade on wages and income inequality within and across rural counties. The project will utilize 4-digit industrial shipment and foreign export shipment data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). The LRD data will be aggregated to the county-level and will be linked with 4-digit international import and export data and exchange rate data to create a unique, county-level, international export and import exchange rate dataset. This new dataset will be used to estimate via regression modeling the county-level employment, income and wage effects of changing patterns of international trade between 1972 and 1997. The employment and wage models will also utilize LRD data on average, production, and nonproduction worker manufacturing employment wages. Other data for the project will come from publicly available sources including the Regional Economic Information Systems (REIS) data series and the Census of Population. Improved understanding of the quality of census data will be accomplished through analysis of the 1997 export estimates. These estimates, which have not yet been evaluated in comparison to prior census years, will be compared to export measures in the 1987 and 1992 Economic Censuses.

"Multi-year Measures of Income and Poverty","This project investigates whether official Census measures of poverty, income, and the income distribution (and of the impact of government tax and transfer policies on these measures) can be improved by taking into account more than a single year’s worth of income (potentially up to an individual’s entire lifetime). This project will benefit the Census Bureau in five ways. First, the predominant purpose of this study is to improve Census measures of poverty and income by incorporating multi-year measures. Second, in the process of conducting this research I will compare SIPP survey measures of earnings and Social Security benefits with administrative data on these same measures. Third, I will compare SIPP measures of earnings among workers with multiple jobs to administrative data on jobs for each individual. Fourth, I will compare the SIPP topical module on lifetime work history with administrative earnings data. Fifth, I will develop and evaluate a dynamic statistical model for imputing earnings levels above the Social Security taxable maximum that will be useful in constructing the “potential PIA” variable that the Census Bureau is planning to add to the SIPP.","Earnings Responses to Increases in Payroll Taxes","Jeffrey Liebman and Emmanuel Saez.

"Family Resources, Race, and Small Business Outcomes","The high failure rates, low profits, and small employment sizes of black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, relative to their white and Asian counterparts, are of concern to many policy makers.  To date, we do not fully understand why black- and Hispanic-owned firms lag behind white and Asian-owned firms.  In the proposed research project, I will use data from the Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) to explore the role that intergenerational links in self-employment play in contributing to racial differences in small business outcomes, such as failures, sales, profits, and employment size.  A careful examination of how family business experience differs by race and ethnicity may uncover some answers.  The inability of blacks and Hispanics to acquire business experience may be at the root of their limited success in business ownership.  Furthermore, family-owned businesses have historically provided a route out of poverty and into long-term, sometimes intergenerational, self-sufficiency for many families.  A better understanding of this process may shed light on why some families are not successful in their small businesses.","Why are Black-Owned Businesses Less Successful than White-Owned Businesses?

"Location, growth, and productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors","This proposal has four interrelated parts, which use Census Bureau establishment level data for the manufacturing, headquarters, and business, professional, and financial service sectors. The first part that applies throughout examines the utility of these Census data by evaluating both their quality and their ability to characterize potentially important developments in these sectors. The other three parts deal with the specifics of the economic investigations using these data. What are these investigations? Certain service and headquarters activities locate disproportionately in the largest metro areas, while manufacturing is found disproportionately in smaller towns and cities. Broadly defined business services have twice the share of employment in the largest metro areas as they do in the smallest cities, while for manufacturing it is the other way around. The question is why; and, hence, what is the role of large metro areas versus small and medium size cities in a country. To start to understand the forces at work, we need to examine at a micro level the local growth patterns, productivity, and outsourcing decisions in these industries. Urban agglomeration is determined primarily by two related forces. First are local scale externalities from information spillovers and labor market operations, whether internal to an industry or deriving from the overall scale of the local urban environment. Second are the benefits to local firms from local linkages in input and output markets. To what extent are headquarters in metro areas to take advantage of the diversity of local intermediate service inputs, as opposed to gather information about innovations, export markets, financing, and the like through local information spillovers from, say, other headquarters? Similarly, why are services located in the largest and most expensive metro areas? To what extent is it local scale externalities within the service sector, versus upstream and downstream linkages within the service sector, versus linkages to sectors using services (e.g., headquarters) where those sectors may experience high own-sector scale externalities? The first two sections of the proposal examine these issues through a detailed analysis of city growth of headquarters and service industries, out-sourcing decisions, and productivity of headquarters and service sector firms. A variety of questions are explored econometrically. The third section of the proposal looks at the determinants of industry mobility across cities. The fourth section of the proposal illustrates issues concerning the utility of the data that this work will examine in the course of data preparation and analysis. The proposal involves the use of the Longitudinal Research Data [LRD] for manufacturing, the Company Auxiliary Organization [CAO] and the Large Company Survey [ES-9100] for headquarters and firms, the Standard Statistical Establishment List [SSEL] and the time linked version of that [LBD] for service sector establishments, and the Assets and Expenditures Survey [AES] for service establishment material, service, and capital inputs (including computers). The CAO and ES-9100 have been rarely used in the past; the LBD has just been constructed to link establishments over time; and the AES has never been used by academic researchers. The project will benefit Census Bureau programs in understanding the quality of data produced through Census surveys, as well as identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs. The part of the project which employs location information (in the LRD, CAO, and AES) to examine plant location and mobility across geographic areas will help identify strengths and weaknesses of current geo-coding operations. It will reveal trends in industrial location that the Census Bureau should be aware of in its future collection activities. The service-outsourcing component of the project is the first systematic look at the importance of collecting (or not collecting) this kind of cost data. Expenditure questions for business services such as legal and accounting were only first asked in the 1992 ASM. The project will help understand if these costs are a significant proportion of total production costs for plants, headquarters and firms in the AES, CAO, ES-9100, and Annual Survey of Manufactures [ASM] and how such costs vary across service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The analysis will reveal which categories of purchased services are most important items for data collection in different surveys. It will also reveal whether questions about out-sourcing in categories such as repair services are properly constructed or whether more questions about intrafirm relations and exchange of services would be helpful in either the CAO, ES-9100, or plant surveys. The project will investigate headquarters and service industry survey responses that in general have been little explored by researchers and analysts beyond the basic Title 13 reporting activity conducted by Census. This work parallels the extensive expansion of the service sector surveys currently underway within the Census Economic Survey programs. Given how dynamic these sectors of the economy are, the analysis of this project will help provide important input to the evaluation and anticipation of the changes occurring in these sectors and their impact on survey execution. Opportunities can be uncovered for question clarification to improve the accuracy of the information reported by survey respondents. For example, does the AES include all the key pieces of information on the economic behavior of large service firms, are certain questions ill-designed to induce the desired correct response, or are some questions irrelevant? How useful for economic analyses are the individual industry Census of Services questionnaires and well do they integrate into the AES for analysis? The scope of the project includes many data sets. By linking the data sets together by firm, it is possible to identify the extent to which the establishments and firms match up over the surveys. Because each are the result of different survey processes, the linking will help clarify coverage of multiestablishment firms’ activity and information gathered. Is there organizational complexity that is not currently being correctly captured by the surveys? Can we infer new information by combining the surveys? For example, is there additional detail on the functions of auxiliary establishments that can be uncovered using the industry classifications of other operating units in the same firm? Do outsourcing expenditures for, say, legal services for establishments across the surveys add up to the totals reported for the firm? If not, can the differences be identified and understood? Are differences expected or problematic, and if so what can be done to improve coverage?","Marshall’s Scale Economies","Henderson, J.V.

"Location, growth, and productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors","This proposal has four interrelated parts, which use Census Bureau establishment level data for the manufacturing, headquarters, and business, professional, and financial service sectors. The first part that applies throughout examines the utility of these Census data by evaluating both their quality and their ability to characterize potentially important developments in these sectors. The other three parts deal with the specifics of the economic investigations using these data. What are these investigations? Certain service and headquarters activities locate disproportionately in the largest metro areas, while manufacturing is found disproportionately in smaller towns and cities. Broadly defined business services have twice the share of employment in the largest metro areas as they do in the smallest cities, while for manufacturing it is the other way around. The question is why; and, hence, what is the role of large metro areas versus small and medium size cities in a country. To start to understand the forces at work, we need to examine at a micro level the local growth patterns, productivity, and outsourcing decisions in these industries. Urban agglomeration is determined primarily by two related forces. First are local scale externalities from information spillovers and labor market operations, whether internal to an industry or deriving from the overall scale of the local urban environment. Second are the benefits to local firms from local linkages in input and output markets. To what extent are headquarters in metro areas to take advantage of the diversity of local intermediate service inputs, as opposed to gather information about innovations, export markets, financing, and the like through local information spillovers from, say, other headquarters? Similarly, why are services located in the largest and most expensive metro areas? To what extent is it local scale externalities within the service sector, versus upstream and downstream linkages within the service sector, versus linkages to sectors using services (e.g., headquarters) where those sectors may experience high own-sector scale externalities? The first two sections of the proposal examine these issues through a detailed analysis of city growth of headquarters and service industries, out-sourcing decisions, and productivity of headquarters and service sector firms. A variety of questions are explored econometrically. The third section of the proposal looks at the determinants of industry mobility across cities. The fourth section of the proposal illustrates issues concerning the utility of the data that this work will examine in the course of data preparation and analysis. The proposal involves the use of the Longitudinal Research Data [LRD] for manufacturing, the Company Auxiliary Organization [CAO] and the Large Company Survey [ES-9100] for headquarters and firms, the Standard Statistical Establishment List [SSEL] and the time linked version of that [LBD] for service sector establishments, and the Assets and Expenditures Survey [AES] for service establishment material, service, and capital inputs (including computers). The CAO and ES-9100 have been rarely used in the past; the LBD has just been constructed to link establishments over time; and the AES has never been used by academic researchers. The project will benefit Census Bureau programs in understanding the quality of data produced through Census surveys, as well as identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs. The part of the project which employs location information (in the LRD, CAO, and AES) to examine plant location and mobility across geographic areas will help identify strengths and weaknesses of current geo-coding operations. It will reveal trends in industrial location that the Census Bureau should be aware of in its future collection activities. The service-outsourcing component of the project is the first systematic look at the importance of collecting (or not collecting) this kind of cost data. Expenditure questions for business services such as legal and accounting were only first asked in the 1992 ASM. The project will help understand if these costs are a significant proportion of total production costs for plants, headquarters and firms in the AES, CAO, ES-9100, and Annual Survey of Manufactures [ASM] and how such costs vary across service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The analysis will reveal which categories of purchased services are most important items for data collection in different surveys. It will also reveal whether questions about out-sourcing in categories such as repair services are properly constructed or whether more questions about intrafirm relations and exchange of services would be helpful in either the CAO, ES-9100, or plant surveys. The project will investigate headquarters and service industry survey responses that in general have been little explored by researchers and analysts beyond the basic Title 13 reporting activity conducted by Census. This work parallels the extensive expansion of the service sector surveys currently underway within the Census Economic Survey programs. Given how dynamic these sectors of the economy are, the analysis of this project will help provide important input to the evaluation and anticipation of the changes occurring in these sectors and their impact on survey execution. Opportunities can be uncovered for question clarification to improve the accuracy of the information reported by survey respondents. For example, does the AES include all the key pieces of information on the economic behavior of large service firms, are certain questions ill-designed to induce the desired correct response, or are some questions irrelevant? How useful for economic analyses are the individual industry Census of Services questionnaires and well do they integrate into the AES for analysis? The scope of the project includes many data sets. By linking the data sets together by firm, it is possible to identify the extent to which the establishments and firms match up over the surveys. Because each are the result of different survey processes, the linking will help clarify coverage of multiestablishment firms’ activity and information gathered. Is there organizational complexity that is not currently being correctly captured by the surveys? Can we infer new information by combining the surveys? For example, is there additional detail on the functions of auxiliary establishments that can be uncovered using the industry classifications of other operating units in the same firm? Do outsourcing expenditures for, say, legal services for establishments across the surveys add up to the totals reported for the firm? If not, can the differences be identified and understood? Are differences expected or problematic, and if so what can be done to improve coverage?","Networking off Madison Avenue","Mohammad Arzaghi & J. Vernon Henderson, 2008.

"Location, growth, and productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors","This proposal has four interrelated parts, which use Census Bureau establishment level data for the manufacturing, headquarters, and business, professional, and financial service sectors. The first part that applies throughout examines the utility of these Census data by evaluating both their quality and their ability to characterize potentially important developments in these sectors. The other three parts deal with the specifics of the economic investigations using these data. What are these investigations? Certain service and headquarters activities locate disproportionately in the largest metro areas, while manufacturing is found disproportionately in smaller towns and cities. Broadly defined business services have twice the share of employment in the largest metro areas as they do in the smallest cities, while for manufacturing it is the other way around. The question is why; and, hence, what is the role of large metro areas versus small and medium size cities in a country. To start to understand the forces at work, we need to examine at a micro level the local growth patterns, productivity, and outsourcing decisions in these industries. Urban agglomeration is determined primarily by two related forces. First are local scale externalities from information spillovers and labor market operations, whether internal to an industry or deriving from the overall scale of the local urban environment. Second are the benefits to local firms from local linkages in input and output markets. To what extent are headquarters in metro areas to take advantage of the diversity of local intermediate service inputs, as opposed to gather information about innovations, export markets, financing, and the like through local information spillovers from, say, other headquarters? Similarly, why are services located in the largest and most expensive metro areas? To what extent is it local scale externalities within the service sector, versus upstream and downstream linkages within the service sector, versus linkages to sectors using services (e.g., headquarters) where those sectors may experience high own-sector scale externalities? The first two sections of the proposal examine these issues through a detailed analysis of city growth of headquarters and service industries, out-sourcing decisions, and productivity of headquarters and service sector firms. A variety of questions are explored econometrically. The third section of the proposal looks at the determinants of industry mobility across cities. The fourth section of the proposal illustrates issues concerning the utility of the data that this work will examine in the course of data preparation and analysis. The proposal involves the use of the Longitudinal Research Data [LRD] for manufacturing, the Company Auxiliary Organization [CAO] and the Large Company Survey [ES-9100] for headquarters and firms, the Standard Statistical Establishment List [SSEL] and the time linked version of that [LBD] for service sector establishments, and the Assets and Expenditures Survey [AES] for service establishment material, service, and capital inputs (including computers). The CAO and ES-9100 have been rarely used in the past; the LBD has just been constructed to link establishments over time; and the AES has never been used by academic researchers. The project will benefit Census Bureau programs in understanding the quality of data produced through Census surveys, as well as identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs. The part of the project which employs location information (in the LRD, CAO, and AES) to examine plant location and mobility across geographic areas will help identify strengths and weaknesses of current geo-coding operations. It will reveal trends in industrial location that the Census Bureau should be aware of in its future collection activities. The service-outsourcing component of the project is the first systematic look at the importance of collecting (or not collecting) this kind of cost data. Expenditure questions for business services such as legal and accounting were only first asked in the 1992 ASM. The project will help understand if these costs are a significant proportion of total production costs for plants, headquarters and firms in the AES, CAO, ES-9100, and Annual Survey of Manufactures [ASM] and how such costs vary across service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The analysis will reveal which categories of purchased services are most important items for data collection in different surveys. It will also reveal whether questions about out-sourcing in categories such as repair services are properly constructed or whether more questions about intrafirm relations and exchange of services would be helpful in either the CAO, ES-9100, or plant surveys.

"Prospects for Los Angeles in an Era of Globalization: Structural Economic Change, Employment Issues and Policy","In this research, we propose to investigate the impacts of globalization on the economy of Los Angeles and the wider region of Southern California. Our objective is to build analytical models of the interface between the local and the global economies in order to assess not just the immediate and most obvious impacts of globalization (such as changes in volume of trade and industrial specialization) but also to trace the indirect effects of globalization on the character and likely trajectory of local economic development. We plan to identify and to map the diverse weak and strong points of the local economy in relation to globalization processes, and to pinpoint their precise locations in Los Angeles’ production system. Key industrial clusters will be identified, and the nature of their local and global linkages will be detailed. At the same time, we will look closely at the relationship between processes of globalization and the structure of local labor markets in Los Angeles. We intend to explore the local employment effects of globalization, first through analysis of changes in the supply and demand for workers with different skills, and second through investigation of the local labor market impacts of these changes on different segments of the population, especially African-Americans, Hispanics, women and immigrants.

"Firm Organization, Internal Capital Markets and Merger and Acquisition Activity","Our planned research centers on the question on how producers with different organizational structures react to long-term shifts in industry demand. Several recent papers have analyzed the failure rates of firms in industries, and have related the clustering of firm exits to stages in an industry’s evolution ((Gort and Klepper (1982), Jovanovic (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990), Klepper (1996). Not much is known about how a producer’s organizational form affects its reaction to industry shocks and how it predicts the redeployment of productive assets in the next stage of the industry’s evolution. In particular, it may be that the advantage of belonging to a larger organization and having access to internal capital markets is particularly significant at times when industry-level cost or demand shifts. We therefore focus on examining the relation between the organizational forms of firms and the long-run characteristics of the industries in which they operate, and on how these factors affect acquisition and survival probabilities of firms. The project will examine relationships among the firm identifiers, industry classification, and accounting information in the Census Bureau’s Census of Manufacturers (CM), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and COMPUSTAT. Using recently developed links between COMPUSTAT and the CES data, we will be able to assess the relative importance of public and private firms in the Census Bureau’s various surveys. Public firms can raise capital by issuing securities publicly to a broad class of investors and may be a larger source of growth for the economy and thus more should be known about these firms. Specific substitutive insights about the quality of the Census Bureau’s economic surveys we can provide in this area include the amount of sales at the firm level are distributed between manufacturing and non-manufacturing, and how much investment takes place at the divisional level outside of manufacturing. We will be enhancing the Census of Manufactures data with the financial data from COMPUSTAT. We will provide information from our study that will help the Census Bureau improve the sampling frame for the ASM by comparing the sample of establishments that is in the CM and ASM and the set of publicly traded firms from COMPUSTAT and by assessing the relative sampling weights of private vs. public firms on COMPUSTAT. We estimate how firm financial resources (data from COMPUSTAT) affect firm’s real business decisions (data obtained from the CM and ASM), such as investment, acquisitions, and mergers. Using the links provided between COMPUSTAT & the LRD data we can thus study the interactions between financial structure and financing patterns and firms real decisions (technology adoption, investment, mergers) and thus increase information that the Census Bureau can provide without the budget cost of a new or expanded survey or census, and without increasing respondent burden. We can aid the Census Bureau by examining whether ASM establishments are being sampled at the appropriate weights given criteria of sampling both representative public and private firms. We can see what fraction of COMPUSTAT small firms are currently being sampled in the ASM and compare it to the fraction of non-COMPUSTAT firms that are being sampled.","Post-merger restructuring and the boundaries of the firm","Maksimovic V., Phillips G., and N.

"Do Spin-offs and Carve-outs Discipline Firm Management? Empirical Evidence.","We propose to study the impact of different forms of corporate restructuring on the labor market decisions, R&D activities, capital structure, and productivity of the firm and its establishments. We specifically consider spin-offs and equity carve-outs. Recently, the theoretical literature has argued that spin-offs and carve-outs have a disciplining effect on firm management. This literature has shown that restructuring increases the probability of a takeover of firms undergoing spin-offs and carve-outs by rival firms with better management ability, thus disciplining management and lowering managerial discretion. If managerial discretion decreases in this manner, we expect that the labor market decisions and R&D activities of the firm would be adversely affected following such restructuring. Establishments undergoing such restructuring will have poor productivity prior to the restructuring, with productivity improving after restructuring. This study proposes to test these hypotheses by comparing wages, employment, productivity, R&D activities, and capital structure of these establishments both before and after the restructuring to a control group of establishments that have not undergone such restructuring. Moreover we attempt to distinguish between the effects of such corporate restructuring on production and non-production workers. Our proposed study directly benefits the Census Bureau’s data by precisely identifying two types of corporate restructuring events, namely spin-offs and equity carveouts. We propose to identify all establishments of manufacturing firms, which had a spin-off or a carveout, by linking up the LRD and OCD with other databases, such as CRSP, Compustat, and SDC, which provide information on such restructuring events. This will help in correctly identifying the type of ownership change and thus enhance the quality of the LRD data. Our study will also help in better identifying establishments over time in a way that correctly treats the transfer of ownership and control. By linking up the SDC to the LRD, our study will help to remove possible inconsistencies related to ownership changes of establishments in the LRD data. The aim of our analysis is to provide a complete picture of the effects of corporate restructuring on the productivity of a firm, and on the employment and wages of the entire hierarchy of the firm: from executives, and central office employees, to both white and blue-collar plant level employees.","How is Value Created in Spin-Offs?

"Diversification discount or premium? New evidence from BITS establishment-level data","This project will accomplish two research objectives. First, it will revise a paper produced as part of the earlier project “Corporate Diversification and Quasi-Diversification: Causes and Consequences” (LA 99-05). The paper examines whether the finding of a diversification discount in U.S. stock markets is only an artifact of the use of Compustat segment data. Using a common methodological approach on a sample of firms which exhibit a diversification discount according to segment data, it finds that, when BITS data are used, diversified firms actually trade at a significant average premium. The second research objective of this project is to revise and conclude the author’s earlier efforts to match establishment-level data from the Census Bureau’s Business Information Tracking Series (BITS) to firm-level data from Standard and Poor’s Compustat. The resulting database provides information on the financial characteristics of public U.S. firms and a more objective and detailed breakdown of their activities by industry than that offered by segment-level data. The merged database is therefore an extremely rich source of information that can be used to investigate a variety of topics. The author will be making available to the Center for Economic Studies the matching file that will enable future researchers at the Center to recreate the merged dataset, together with a document that will describe in detail the process followed to create that matching file.","Diversification Discount or Premium?

"Measuring the Productivity Impact of Wireless Technology","The growing literature on the productivity impact of information technology has revealed that while IT produces large benefits on average, there is usually a significant amount of variation in its firm-level effects. Researchers have turned to organizational differences between firms to help explain this variation, arguing that in many cases there are complementarities between the use of IT and the organization of the enterprise. The empirical challenge is to deal with the problems of endogenous technology adoption and unobserved firm-level heterogeneity that are present in most productivity studies.

The adoption of computerized dispatching technology by taxicab fleets provides a unique opportunity to examine the issue of complementarities between economic organization and technology adoption. The taxicab industry contains a large number of firms delivering a relatively homogeneous good and computerized dispatch technology has had a major impact on the productivity of taxi fleets. Moreover, the contracting between taxi drivers and fleet operators (i.e. whether drivers are employees or contractors) is a significant organization decision that should influence the IT adoption decision. Finally, differences in local regulatory and market conditions provide a source of exogenous variation in the costs and benefits of IT use and different modes of driver contracting.

This project proposes to utilize establishment level data on taxi and livery fleets to test for complementarities between driver contracting and the use of computerized dispatch technology. The econometric tests will include traditional approaches, such as production function estimation, as well as a novel structural method that jointly estimates a production function and the choice of contracting mode.

The empirical challenge is to deal with the problems of endogenous technology adoption and unobserved firm-level heterogeneity that are present in most productivity studies.

The adoption of computerized dispatching technology by taxicab fleets provides a unique opportunity to examine the issue of complementarities between economic organization and technology adoption. The taxicab industry contains a large number of firms delivering a relatively homogeneous good and computerized dispatch technology has had a major impact on the productivity of taxi fleets. Moreover, the contracting between taxi drivers and fleet operators (i.e. whether drivers are employees or contractors) is a significant organization decision that should influence the IT adoption decision. Finally, differences in local regulatory and market conditions provide a source of exogenous variation in the costs and benefits of IT use and different modes of driver contracting.

This project proposes to utilize establishment level data on taxi and livery fleets to test for complementarities between driver contracting and the use of computerized dispatch technology. The econometric tests will include traditional approaches, such as production function estimation, as well as a novel structural method that jointly estimates a production function and the choice of contracting mode.

"Rural Civic Community and Population Stability: Linking Civic Structure and Individual Migration Behavior","Many rural communities are losing economically and socially viable populations, tax bases, essential services, and retail establishments. But, there are also cases of rural communities that are thriving and, in doing so, are retaining their populations and stemming the tide of rural out-migration. Our proposed research will evaluate the factors that aid rural communities in retaining their population. Specifically this research will analyze the effect of the civic institution in rural communities (such as churches, local businesses and local associations) upon individuals – probabilities of staying in their communities. Individual migration/nonmigration behavior will be modeled using the full internal decennial microdata for 1990 and 2000 (as it becomes available). County contextual effects on these individual behaviors will be modeled using internal Economic Census microdata from 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997 as well as from publicly available county level data (such as the Census of Agriculture). The individual models will summarize the effects of individual economic, demographic and social characteristics that affect migration/nonmigration behavior. County contextual effects will quantify the influence of community economic conditions and social conditions that alter these individual behavioral models. Assessment of these contextual estimates will summarize the degree to which community structure alters individual behavior. Thus our research objectives are first to specify the relationship between rural community context and individual migration behavior, and second to test the relative importance of individual characteristics, community economic characteristics and community social characteristics in retaining rural populations. Our approach will also provide a number of benefits to the US Census Bureau. These benefits include linking decennial and economic data over time at the county level and linking the decennial time series and economic census time series on counties together. Further we will provide an important alternative measurement for migration in these data, by evaluating two measures of migration – cross county migration and cross labor market migration. This latter definition may provide a clear demarcation between purely residential movements within a community and economically determined movements between communities. Comparison of predictive estimates for the two types of migration will quantify these differences. We believe our project will also provide an important quality assessment of the 2000 decennial data. By linking 1990 to 2000 data, then modeling individual migration behaviors (and relevant characteristics) we will provide a unique quality assessment of the 2000 data. Our research approach models individual behaviors at the county level and assesses contextual differences among counties in these predicted behaviors. As we evaluate the stability of individual migration behavior within each county in 1990 and 2000 we will identify counties where sharp changes in our predictive models occur, and assess whether such differences are due to changes in contextual conditions or are artifacts of Census coverage in the two time periods.","Stability and Change in Individual Determinants of Migration: Evidence from 1985-1990 and 1995 to 2000","Charles Tolbert & Troy Blanchard & Michael Irwin, 2006.

"Using the Survey of Plant Capacity to Measure Capital Utilization","Most capital in the United States is idle much of the time. By some measures, the average work week of capital in U.S. manufacturing is as low as 55 hours per 168-hour week. The level and variability of capital utilization has important implications for understanding both the level of production and its cyclical fluctuations. This proposal will investigate a number of issues relating to the Survey of Plant Capacity measures. It will aim to better understand the behavior of these measures in the panel of plants and in the aggregate. It will use this analysis to make recommendations on expanding and improving the published statistics deriving from the Survey of Plant Capacity. These statistics could increase the value of this survey at low incremental cost. This improved information about the utilization margin would be a substantial benefit for economists and decision makers. Capital utilization is an important margin for understanding fluctuations in output and productivity at the plant and aggregate level and in firms’ decisions about adding or subtracting from their stocks of factors of production. This research will examine how Survey of Plant Capacity measurements can contribute to studying these issues.","Using the Survey of Plant Capacity to Measure Capital Utilization","Gorodnichenko, Yuriy, and Matthew D.

"Health and Migration in the Continental United States","Mounting evidence that similar individuals residing in different places have varying life chances has given rise to the possibility that racially-segregated urban environments have a particularly insidious impact on the health of African American residents of high poverty urban areas. However, observed geographic patterning of health outcomes might also reflect systematic health-related migration across local residential areas -- for example, the in- or out- migration of the most or least healthy residents into high poverty urban areas. Research on this issue is scant because few data sets link health and migration. 
Our primary goal is to test the hypothesis that selective health-related migration affects geographic variations in local population health. To do so, we will need to analyze confidential data from responses to the Census question that asks respondents to the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses where they resided 5 years earlier. Thus, for our work at the Research Data Center, we propose to use the Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF) of the 1990 Decennial Census, and the similar data from the 2000 census when it becomes available. The SEDF represents roughly 16% of the population and includes all the long-form records including the critical question on prior residence that is not available on the public use files released by the Census Bureau. Of benefit to the Bureau, this project will improve understanding of the quality of Census data and improve Census-based estimates of local population health. Should we find that health related migration biases estimates of population health, this will identify shortcomings of current data collection and document new data collection needs. By estimating disability rates for select high poverty and minority populations, taking selective health-related migration into account, we will provide more accurate estimates of the health status of these local populations than currently exist. In addition, our study will shed light on the feasibility of using the Census to study short distance moves and will enable us to determine the extent and nature of missing data on relevant items. If our results support the value of using detailed geography when studying migration patterns, it would suggest that, subject to other considerations, the Census might consider including more detailed geographic information, such as census tract of prior residence, in the data released for use at Research Data Centers, so that investigators do not have to rely on “county” or census “place” of prior residence.","Residential Mobility Across Local Areas in the United States and the Geographic Distribution of the Healthy Population","Geronimus, Arline T., John Bound, and Annie Ro. 2014. “Residential Mobility Across Local Areas in the United States and the Geographic Distribution of the Healthy Population.” Demography 51: 777-809.

"The Importance of Relocations in U.S. Manufacturing","A firm can grow over a sustained period of time by renewing itself through recurrent responses to various internal and external challenges. In the short run, a firm expands and contracts its activities and the number of workers it employs. Some radical changes in the environment, however, may lead a firm to shut down a plant and start over in a new location. Because of this, competition among state and local governments to lure businesses has attracted considerable interest from economists, as well as legislators and decision-makers, regarding issues influencing relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities. While this process of relocation can cause dramatic shifts in activity and employment at the regional levels, as well as at the firm levels, very little is known about the actual patterns of relocation in the U.S. economy. Only a few previous studies have looked at how manufacturing firms geographically locate their production, and most of these have focused on either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This project expands on this previous work by summarizing the patterns of plant relocation and the post-move performance of relocated plants using the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period 1963-1999 using non-publicly available plant and firm level data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Focusing on an individual firm’s decision to relocate, this project analyzes information on the relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities in the following three subprojects. First, this project assesses the relative importance of relocation across industries and regions by constructing industry level measures of entry, relocation, and exit. The study then examines whether relocation produces different patterns in plant openings and closings compared to de novo entry and permanent exit. Second, this project studies the characteristics of relocated plants along with their decision to relocate. Econometric model estimation will characterize how individual firms’ geographic shifts of production processes are influenced by taxes, unionization, factor prices, ownership, and other geographic and plant specific characteristics. Third, this project investigates the impact of geographic shifts on a firm’s post move production by comparing the growth rates of output and productivity for newly relocated plants to those of existing plants in the original location. The inverse growth-age relation suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) firm- learning model is tested for relocating plants to examine whether the inverse growth-age relation observed among young firms also holds for relocating plants that start over in a new space. This project provides a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. These benefits include producing new statistics on the geographic movement of manufacturing activities at the firm level thereby suggesting a new way to expand the utility of the LRD in describing the geographic patterns of economic activities in the United States. Results of this research may also demonstrate the need for new measures of relocation to be incorporated in future surveys. Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List.","Relocation patterns in U.S. manufacturing","Yoonsoo Lee, 2006.

Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List.","Geographic Redistribution of the U.S. Manufacturing and The Role of State Development Policy","Yoonsoo Lee, 2007.

"Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing: Phase II.","Industrial energy demand typically involves base load consumption. As a result the industrial component of energy demand has important implications in evaluating energy infrastructure, i.e. oil, gas, electric power. There is growing concern that the energy infrastructure could be subject to both natural (e.g. storms or equipment failure) and manmade (e.g. terrorist) disruptions. To address the economic and human implications of such a disruption, planning agencies are taking a closer look at the energy infrastructure and its customers to assess its robustness and ability to continue vital functions as well as identify potential weaknesses. This project uses the LRD and MECS databases to estimate a distribution-company-level model of industrial energy demand for natural gas and electricity via a plant-level energy demand equation. An element unique to this study is the use of “establishment location” in a geographic information system (GIS) to create new, supplemental data on the relationship between the plant and the energy distribution system. These supplemental data are then used to improve the forecasting abilities of the econometric model. The benefits to the Census Bureau include 1) the creation of the GIS layers that can be used to access various data sources such as the LRD, MECS, and SSEL, in an intuitive visual mode which highlights spatial relationships, 2) the link across the LRD and MECS to create plant-level energy prices, and 3) the forecasting equations that can be used to impute non-response to energy questions in the ASM and MECS.","The Evolution of the Energy Star Industrial Energy Performance Indicator for Benchmarking Plant Level Manufacturing Energy Use","Boyd, G., E.

"Revised: The Impact of Minimum Quality Standards on the Child Care Market","We propose to examine the impact of minimum quality standards on the supply side of the child care market, using a unique panel data set merged from the Census of Services Industries (1987-1997, establishments with payroll), state regulation Data (1987-1996), and accreditation data (1986-1997) from National Association of Education for Young Children (NAEYC). The welfare effect of minimum quality standards is theoretically controversial and empirically poorly documented due to data limitations. The panel nature of this data set will make this study able to control state fixed effects and time fixed effects, in order to better answer: Will more stringent minimum quality standards reduce supply in the child care market? Will more stringent standards force more firms to exit the market? Will more stringent standards motivate firms to pursue higher quality via accreditation? This study will be the first in the field in the sense that it uses panel data to study the supply side of a market subject to minimum quality standards. This proposal will benefit the Census Bureau by incorporating external sources of data into the Census data, corroborating the Census data, providing estimates of the child care industry, and understanding industry dynamics.","The Impact of Minimum Quality Standards on Firm Entry, Exit and Product Quality: The Case of the Child Care Market","V.

"Intergenerational Inequality in the US","This research project proposes three major areas of study in order to better understand the intergenerational transmission of inequality. First, building on Mazumder’s previous work, the 1984 and 1990 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to the Social Security Administration’s Summary Earnings Records (SER) and Detailed Earnings Records (DER) will be used to measure the intergenerational elasticity in earnings between fathers and their children. Second, a highly structured model of earnings dynamics will be estimated using pooled data from the 1984, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996 SIPPs matched to both the SER and DER. Among other things, this will provide a definitive view of the degree to which the rise in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s reflected changes in the distribution of permanent income. Third, a rich array of measures of family background and neighborhood characteristics will be used to better understand the underlying process by which income is transmitted from parents to children. This analysis will make use of the internal SIPP and Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) files that contain the detailed geographic identifiers. There are four benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau that will be derived from this study: an analysis of the reliability of using short-term averages of SIPP earnings as a proxy for permanent earnings, a study of the quality of earnings data for an attrited sample such as the SPD, an analysis of the quality of self-employment income data in the SIPP, and an analysis of the biases from using a sample derived from a match based on social security numbers.","Black-White Differences in Intergenerational Economic Mobility in the United States","Mazumder, Bhashkar. 2014. “Black-White Differences in Intergenerational Economic Mobility in the United States.” Economic Perspectives1: 1-18.

"Political Environments and Manufacturing Employment and Investment","This study will characterize how changes in political environments from 1963–2000 influenced the employment and investment decisions, including technology adoption, of manufacturing establishments. Special attention will be given to the impact of elections themselves, including expectations of the candidates’ ideologies. In the face of uncertain elections, are plants more reserved in their hiring or investing behavior? Do the victories of candidates with very strong ideologies lead to discrete adjustments in anticipation of future conditions? Three econometric specifications will be considered: standard cross-sectional regressions; a state border discontinuity analysis; and a longitudinal analysis using a balanced 1973–1988 panel of Annual Survey of Manufacturing plants. Use of detailed plant data housed at the Center for Economic Studies is essential for isolating the impact of local politics on establishment behavior, employing a border effects analysis that requires county identification, and characterizing the different reactions of local, single-plant firms versus establishments part of large, regionally-diverse enterprises. 
This project is a response to the July 2001 Research Opportunities at the Census Bureau publication that requests proposals studying how higher-order moments (i.e., skewness, kurtosis) of the cross-section distribution of investment and employment variables should be made publicly available. To identify the influences of regional political environments and elections, I will need to calculate these higher-order moments for individual states and perhaps smaller county/MSA divisions. In a technical memo, I will be able to characterize the best candidate metrics for release from the perspectives of the Census Bureau and potential researchers, the limits to disaggregating geographically these moments (either due to confidentiality concerns or data quality issues), and if and how these higher-order moments should be calculated in non-Census of Manufacturers years. Additional benefits are also identified in the proposal.","Does Employment Protection Reduce Productivity? Evidence from US States","Autor, David & Kerr, William & Kugler, Adriana, 2007.

"Political Environments and Manufacturing Employment and Investment","This study will characterize how changes in political environments from 1963–2000 influenced the employment and investment decisions, including technology adoption, of manufacturing establishments.

"Efficiency Implications of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Micro Data","In this project, we contribute to the ongoing research on the rationales for corporate diversification. Using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) as our main source of data, we examine whether combining several lines of business under one corporate umbrella leads to increased productive performance. Studying the direct effect of diversification on productive efficiency allows us to discern between two major theories of corporate diversification: the agency cost hypothesis and the synergy hypothesis. Further, the project contributes to the literature by investigating whether efficiency differences between diversified and focused firms lead to the “diversification discount”. To measure productive efficiency, we employ a non-parametric approach, the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM), using establishment-level and firm-level data. This method has several advantages over other conventional measures of productive efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the first application of the WAPM to a sample of non-financial institutions. This project will provide benefits to the Census Bureau’s data programs through understanding and improving the quality of the data. The project will merge the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM/LRD), Census of Manufactures (CM/LRD), Company Auxiliary Offices (CAO), National Employer Survey (NES), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and the time-linked version of the SSEL called the Longitudinal Business Database with the public-use databases COMPUSTAT, Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and Security Data Corporation (SDC). Once the databases are merged, comparisons of the data items collected by the Census Bureau to the data contained in the public-use databases will be performed.","Efficiency Implications of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Micro Data","Ekaterina Emm & Jayant Kale, 2006.

"Technology Use and Worker Outcomes: Evidence from Linked Employer-Employee Data","There is widespread evidence that in the last few decades there has been a widening gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers. Numerous empirical studies suggest there is a link between this growing skill wage differential and the use of new technologies. However, most of these studies have one notable limitation – i.e., they are typically restricted to cross-sectional data, and thus, unable to control for unobservable worker and firm characteristics. This makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of selection bias from the true productivity effects of using these technologies. Distinguishing these two components ideally requires longitudinal information from both workers and firms. With this project we intend to investigate the impact technology use has on workers’ wages in U.S. manufacturing plants by constructing and exploiting a unique Linked Employee-Employer data set containing longitudinal worker and plant information. Among other things, the construction of this dataset will develop links across time and entities using census data and administrative data, will also explore the value of administrative data to provide economic information to enhance census surveys, and furthermore, will identify some shortcomings of census collection programs. We will examine the effect of technology use on wage determination and ask the following questions: Does the skill wage differential increase after the implementation of new technologies in the workplace as suggested by the skill biased technological change hypothesis? Or do high tech firms employ a selection of high ability workers? And if demand for low skilled workers indeed falls after the introduction of new technologies, do we observe the adjustment of prices or quantities? Does the hazard of exiting the firm increase for low skilled workers after the introduction of new technologies? Is skill upgrading a consequence of technology adoption? This project will address these questions using the Long Form of the 1990 Decennial Census, the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies (1988 and 1993), the Business Register (SSEL 1985-1997), and Unemployment Insurance data for the state of Maryland.","The Role of Technological and Industrial Heterogeneity In Technology Diffusion: a Markovian Approach","Adela Luque, 2003.

"Research on Establishment Management Practices Using the National Employer Surveys","This project will use the National Employer Survey (NES), and especially the NES 2000 survey, together with a number of other U.S. Census Bureau datasets, to examine the incidence of various innovative human resource practices (such as employee involvement plans, organizational learning practices, nonstandard employment arrangements, and new personnel practices), the factors that determine their use, and the consequences of such use for organizational and individual outcomes (such as establishment performance, employee wages, and turnover).   This project will provide a number of benefits to the Census Bureau’s data programs, aside from the estimates of characteristics of populations.  Other benefits include assessing the NES’s unique methodology for surveying employees and identifying emerging employment issues—such as the extent to which those working in establishments are not employees of the establishment—that can be used to guide future surveys.","High-Involvement Work Practices and the Opportunities for Promotion in the Organization","Bonet, Rocio. 2014. “High-Involvement Work Practices and the Opportunities for Promotion in the Organization.” Industrial Relations 53: 295-324.

"Improving Data on Emissions and Voluntary Program Participation and Estimating Relationships among Participation, Emissions, and Other Plant Characteristics","
Collected under Title 13, Chapter 5, of the U.S. Code, the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Manufacturing Energy Consumption survey all contain important information about plant-level activity in the United States and associated material and energy use. Over the past decade, voluntary environmental programs have played an increasingly important role in environmental and energy management. Yet existing programs have been subject to only limited empirical study. An important question is whether participation in these programs is important enough to warrant inclusion in future surveys, analogous to current questions about energy management. 
This project will increase the knowledge base of the U.S. Census Bureau and other researchers and analysts by merging existing data with additional information on emissions and voluntary program participation. First, this project will allow us to examine the impact of voluntary program participation and whether it warrants inclusion in future surveys. Second, the project improves our understanding of plant characteristics and activities while checking the quality of existing data. Third, the merged datasets will allow us to calculate population estimates of emissions and other measures of plant activity with and without the voluntary programs. 
All three results promise important benefits for the Census Bureau in its effort to improve the quality and usefulness of both existing Title 13, Chapter 5 data, as well as future survey instruments. Understanding how program participation interacts with other inputs and outputs can indicate whether participation indicators would be useful in future data collection. Comparisons with newly merged datasets allow for verification of some data elements. Even where direct comparisons are not possible, we can observe anomalies in indirect comparisons (for example, energy use and emissions) that signal a quality issue. As we compute population estimates of plant emissions and activity with and without voluntary programs, we will make use of state-of-the-art sample selection techniques. Such techniques, which are analogous to missing data techniques, could prove useful in other areas of work with Census Bureau data where population estimates are necessary despite significant problems with missing data. Finally, we expect this work to generate suggestions for improved survey design in the future. 
The last result will provide some of the first quantified estimates of voluntary program consequences involving careful attention to sample selection issues. Drawing on experience with EPA’s 33/50 and Climate Wise programs, and DOE’s 1605(b) program, the proposed research will identify program consequences based on competing sample selection approaches that jointly model voluntary program participation and emission outcome. The assumptions inherent in these competing models can alter or reverse estimated population effects. Comparing estimates across models and programs, we expect to draw conclusions that will be more robust and therefore more valuable for future decision-making.","The Performance of Industrial Sector Voluntary Climate Programs: Climate Wise and 1605(b)","Pizer, William A., Richard Morgenstern, and Jhih-Shyang Shih. 2012. “The Performance of Industrial Sector Voluntary Climate Programs: Climate Wise and 1605(b).” Energy Policy 39: 7907-7916.

"Financial Protection Provided by Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance","Although large and small firms generally pay similar premiums for health insurance, it is widely believed that these premiums purchase less generous plans for small firms. This lower “actuarial value,” along with the lower wages paid by many small firms, may help to explain why many of them do not offer coverage and why many workers in these firms decline it when offered. The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of medical expense that it will pay for a covered population. It allows us to compare the adequacy of coverage across plans and make value-adjusted comparisons of premiums. While an extensive literature monitors the prevalence of employer-sponsored health insurance across states and firm sizes, surprisingly little has been published about the actuarial value of this insurance and how it varies across states, firm sizes and plan types. This project will examine variations in the actuarial value and value-adjusted price of employer-sponsored health care benefits. It will also examine the financial protection that group insurance affords persons with differing levels of health care use. Finally, it will improve our understanding of why some employees decline to take-up coverage and why some employers don’t offer coverage, by adding the actuarial value of the health care benefit to the list of explanatory factors. The major study database is the Census Bureau’s 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Survey (MEPS-IC). AHRQ’s MEPS Household Survey will also be used together with Watson Wyatt software to simulate the payment of medical claims for a standard employer-sponsored population. Based on these simulations, an actuarial value will be calculated for each of the MEPS-IC health plans. Watson Wyatt, a leading actuarial and benefits consulting firm, will collaborate with the Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) on this study. The study will produce statistical models and at least one journal article that explore these dynamics of job-based health insurance. This project will greatly enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding the actuarial value for each health plan. This proposal has been approved for a $180,000 grant from the Commonwealth Fund. In addition to evaluating and documenting inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPSIC health plan data, we will recommend recodes or imputations to address them. These recodes and imputations can be added to the MEPS-IC data for use by future researchers at the RDC. Watson Wyatt will estimate the actuarial value of each health plan in the MEPS-IC database. The result will be a “benefit rate” that represents the percentage of charges each plan would pay if that plan were offered to a standard population. We will also estimate the plan medical expense and beneficiary out-of-pocket expense for the top ten percent of users, the top 25 percent of users, the top 50 percent of users and the bottom 50 percent of users. These new variables will be required for the proposed project and they will be added to the MEPS-IC file for use by future researchers at the RDC. In the process of calculating the actuarial value for each plan, we will also evaluate and document any internal inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPS-IC plan data. Simulating the actuarial value of a plan is an excellent way to evaluate these data quality issues, because it requires comprehensive examination of plan provisions and the manner in which they interact. The addition of actuarial value to the MEPS-IC file will allow the calculation the mean actuarial value for the population of health plans offered by private sector firms. It will also allow us to profile the distribution of actuarial value of health plans at various points in the distribution. We will calculate these at the 90th percentile, the 75th percentile, the 50th percentile, the 25th percentile and the 10th percentile of actuarial value. We are also prepared to estimate other health plan population characteristics, including premiums, employer contributions, and health plan cost-sharing provisions.","Data Edits and Imputations for 2002 MEPS-IC Simulation of Claims Payment","Roland McDevitt & Jon Gabel, 2008.

In the process of calculating the actuarial value for each plan, we will also evaluate and document any internal inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPS-IC plan data. Simulating the actuarial value of a plan is an excellent way to evaluate these data quality issues, because it requires comprehensive examination of plan provisions and the manner in which they interact. The addition of actuarial value to the MEPS-IC file will allow the calculation the mean actuarial value for the population of health plans offered by private sector firms. It will also allow us to profile the distribution of actuarial value of health plans at various points in the distribution. We will calculate these at the 90th percentile, the 75th percentile, the 50th percentile, the 25th percentile and the 10th percentile of actuarial value. We are also prepared to estimate other health plan population characteristics, including premiums, employer contributions, and health plan cost-sharing provisions.","Creating Plan Actuarial Values for the 2002 MEPS-IC Sample","Jon Gabel & Roland McDevitt, 2006.

"Financial Protection Provided by Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance","Although large and small firms generally pay similar premiums for health insurance, it is widely believed that these premiums purchase less generous plans for small firms. This lower “actuarial value,” along with the lower wages paid by many small firms, may help to explain why many of them do not offer coverage and why many workers in these firms decline it when offered. The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of medical expense that it will pay for a covered population. It allows us to compare the adequacy of coverage across plans and make value-adjusted comparisons of premiums. While an extensive literature monitors the prevalence of employer-sponsored health insurance across states and firm sizes, surprisingly little has been published about the actuarial value of this insurance and how it varies across states, firm sizes and plan types. This project will examine variations in the actuarial value and value-adjusted price of employer-sponsored health care benefits. It will also examine the financial protection that group insurance affords persons with differing levels of health care use. Finally, it will improve our understanding of why some employees decline to take-up coverage and why some employers don’t offer coverage, by adding the actuarial value of the health care benefit to the list of explanatory factors. The major study database is the Census Bureau’s 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Survey (MEPS-IC). AHRQ’s MEPS Household Survey will also be used together with Watson Wyatt software to simulate the payment of medical claims for a standard employer-sponsored population. Based on these simulations, an actuarial value will be calculated for each of the MEPS-IC health plans. Watson Wyatt, a leading actuarial and benefits consulting firm, will collaborate with the Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) on this study. The study will produce statistical models and at least one journal article that explore these dynamics of job-based health insurance. This project will greatly enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding the actuarial value for each health plan. This proposal has been approved for a $180,000 grant from the Commonwealth Fund. In addition to evaluating and documenting inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPSIC health plan data, we will recommend recodes or imputations to address them. These recodes and imputations can be added to the MEPS-IC data for use by future researchers at the RDC. Watson Wyatt will estimate the actuarial value of each health plan in the MEPS-IC database. The result will be a “benefit rate” that represents the percentage of charges each plan would pay if that plan were offered to a standard population. We will also estimate the plan medical expense and beneficiary out-of-pocket expense for the top ten percent of users, the top 25 percent of users, the top 50 percent of users and the bottom 50 percent of users. These new variables will be required for the proposed project and they will be added to the MEPS-IC file for use by future researchers at the RDC.

"Competition and Industry Structure in Food Services","This project will study the linkages among price competition, non-price competition and industry structure in the food services industry. Using information on revenues, prices and non-price product attributes, it will provide direct empirical evidence of how firms’ prices and product choice are related to each other and to industry structure. This will shed light on how firms compete in industries with many firms and heterogeneous products, typical characteristics of the growing services sector. It will add to the knowledge of how markets work by revealing some of the feedback mechanisms between structure and conduct in such markets. The primary dataset will be firm-level microdata for food services establishments from the Economic Census in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997. I will use the information on revenues, prices and product attributes from this dataset to analyze how firms compete in prices and non-price characteristics and to relate market structure to the competitiveness of industry. The analysis will consist mostly of statistical tests and estimation techniques to study the relationships between these variables. Therefore, the output will largely be regression estimates and aggregate statistics. I will work closely with Census staff to avoid inappropriate disclosure. Other datasets to be used in this study are the Business Expenditures Survey (BES), Assets and Expenditures Survey (AES), County Business Patterns (CPB), Country and City Data Books (CCDB), the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) in 1971-1997, where each is available. I will use firm-level operating expenses data from the BES, AES and CPB to control for variation in costs across firms and market-level data to control for variation in costs across markets. The CCDB will provide demographic information to account for variation in tastes across markets. The SSEL contains firm identifiers, name and address files that I will use to track affiliation among establishments. The LBD contains firm identifiers that will help to link the data across years for longitudinal analysis.
This project’s main benefit to the Census will be to provide an evaluation of the quality of the microdata for the food services industry. This will enhance the Census’ understanding of the dataset and provide guidance for improvements to its surveys. Specifically, this project will assess the quality of the data with regard to non-responses, characterize the extent of imputed data, and document higher moments and other statistical characteristics of the distribution of key variables. Furthermore, it will verify the internal consistency of the data and provide the Census with a cleaned and documented dataset that may be useful to other researchers. The proposed project will also enhance the Census microdata by developing links to market-level costs data in the BES and CPB, and to market-level population and household demographics in the CCDB. In addition, for a subset of establishments, it will link the Census microdata to firm-level operating expenses information in the BES. The resulting dataset will contain rich information on costs, prices, product choice and revenues for individual firms. Finally, the project may also provide links over time for these data for longitudinal analysis. Another benefit that will come from this project is the preparation of estimates of several characteristics of the food services establishment population. Estimates of the correlation among prices, product attributes, ownership structure, demand characteristics and costs will enhance the Census’ understanding of how these variables are related in this industry. These estimates will be provided at the market and establishment levels.","Capacity use in multi-unit firms: evidence for efficiency gains or strategic competition in the US restaurant industry?","Clarissa Yeap, 2011.

"Capital Reallocation","This project will study capital reallocation and the liquidity of real assets. Using COMPUSTAT data, we have shown that the amount of capital reallocation is procyclical. In contrast the benefits to capital reallocation appear countercyclical. We find that a counter cyclical process for capital illiquidity can reconcile these series and discuss possible sources of this illiquidity. Our project will build on and extend our previous work. We propose to study the cyclical properties of capital reallocation and capital illiquidity, understand the nature of capital illiquidity, understand the role of used capital markets in firm dynamics, and construct stylized facts describing firm heterogeneity including the cyclical properties of dispersion in productivity, capacity utilization and investment opportunities across firms. This research project on measuring capital reallocation has as its predominant purpose (I) to further the understanding and improve the quality of the data, (ii) to improve the methodology for measurement, and (iii) to prepare estimates of characteristics of the population. By measuring capital at the establishment or firm level and the reallocation of capital (i.e., sale or purchases of capital) across establishments or firms and by comparing the findings from the non-public data to our findings using COMPUSTAT data, the project will further the understanding of the quality of the data and improve the quality of the data. In addition, by documenting what can be learned from the existing data from the ASM/CM and ACES about the reallocation of capital, the project should lead to new or improved methodology to collect data to measure capital and its redeployment in different use. The benefits should compare to the productive interaction between the measurement of labor reallocation by Davis, Haltiwanger and coauthors and the data collection by the Bureau of the Census. The project will result in estimates of population and characteristics of population such as an aggregate capital reallocation series and documentation of its cyclical properties. Furthermore, the project will prepare estimates of dispersion measures of productivity across firms as well as the dynamics of heterogeneity across firms, an important feature of the microdata which has not been sufficiently studied.","Leasing, Ability to Repossess, and Debt Capacity","Andrea L.

"The impact of banking market structure on the life-cycle dynamics of non-financial industries","This project explores the effect of banking market structure on the market structure and growth of nonfinancial industries. It asks whether concentration in the banking market promotes the formation of industries constituted by a few, large firms, or, rather, whether it facilitates the continuous entry of new firms, thus maintaining unconcentrated market structures across industries. Theoretical arguments could be made to support either hypothetical scenario. Further, it looks at the impact of banking market structure on employment growth, new firm entry, and establishment exit rates. Empirical evidence will be derived merging the panel information contained in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with that on the banking industry contained in the publicly available Commercial Bank Report on Condition and Income of the Federal Reserve System. This project will evaluate the quality of the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate census, and LBD data in two ways: 1) by assessing missing items, imputations, and inequalities; and 2) by comparing it to the Commercial Bank and Holding Company Database compiled by the Federal Reserve.","Surviving Credit Market Competition","Cetorelli, Nicola. 2014. “Surviving Credit Market Competition.” Economic Inquiry 52: 320-340.

"Understanding the Behavior of Job Flows over the Business Cycle","The project I am proposing will contribute in four ways to the understanding and improvement of Census data: first, it will develop filtering and flagging programs, which will identify unusual and potentially spurious observations for plants in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM). Second, it will also estimate or impute data for missing observations or observations deemed likely to be spurious. Third, because the project estimates population moments from relatively long panels of plants, it will further the understanding of the representativeness and usefulness of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. Finally, the project will further the understanding of the dynamic behavior of plants, in particular their demand for labor. In this regard, the project proposes to answer two sets of questions related to the behavior of plant level employment: (1) do plants time their restructuring activities to correspond with fluctuations in the business cycle and if so, which types of plants are more likely to do so, and (2) are there asymmetric movements in job flows at the plant level and do these plant-level asymmetric movements, if they exist, translate into asymmetric job flow movements at the aggregate level. Answering these questions requires the construction of panels of plants from the ASM, with panels grouped by relevant plant characteristics, such as size and industry. To prevent spurious data from contaminating results, I will filter out or flag unusual patterns in plants’ time series of characteristics as well as impute data that is either missing or appears spurious. To appropriately interpret my results, I will compare characteristics of plants from my longitudinal samples to the overall ASM, evaluating the representativeness, and hence the usefulness, of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. The data sets I will need are the ASM from 1972 to the most recent available and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) from 1967 to the most recent available. Considerable processing of this data has already been performed in the construction of data files for the Gross Flows project. Thus, I would also like to have access to many of the files constructed from the ASM and the CM in the Gross Flows project.","Why Are Plant Deaths Countercyclical: Reallocation Timing or Fragility?","Andrew Figura, 2006.

The data sets I will need are the ASM from 1972 to the most recent available and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) from 1967 to the most recent available. Considerable processing of this data has already been performed in the construction of data files for the Gross Flows project. Thus, I would also like to have access to many of the files constructed from the ASM and the CM in the Gross Flows project.","Explaining Cyclical Movements in Employment: Creative-Destruction or Changes in Utilization?","Andrew Figura, 2009.

"Understanding the Behavior of Job Flows over the Business Cycle","The project I am proposing will contribute in four ways to the understanding and improvement of Census data: first, it will develop filtering and flagging programs, which will identify unusual and potentially spurious observations for plants in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM). Second, it will also estimate or impute data for missing observations or observations deemed likely to be spurious. Third, because the project estimates population moments from relatively long panels of plants, it will further the understanding of the representativeness and usefulness of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. Finally, the project will further the understanding of the dynamic behavior of plants, in particular their demand for labor. In this regard, the project proposes to answer two sets of questions related to the behavior of plant level employment: (1) do plants time their restructuring activities to correspond with fluctuations in the business cycle and if so, which types of plants are more likely to do so, and (2) are there asymmetric movements in job flows at the plant level and do these plant-level asymmetric movements, if they exist, translate into asymmetric job flow movements at the aggregate level. Answering these questions requires the construction of panels of plants from the ASM, with panels grouped by relevant plant characteristics, such as size and industry.

"How Does Space Matter in Ethnic Labor Market Segmentation?","This study will examine the spatial influences on ethnic labor market segmentation, viz. how the locations of workers’ residences and workplaces influence the emergence of ethnic niche occupations. It argues that human and social capital is built through particular spatial arrangements, and that residential and workplace locations can act to inhibit occupational choices. The study will use the confidential Census data derived from the Decennial Long Form 2000 to conduct a case study of Chinese in the San Francisco CMSA. The study has three objectives: (i) to examine the ethnic segmentation of San Francisco’s labor market and identify Chinese niche sectors; (ii) to identify Chinese residential and workplace concentrations, and examine the social and economic characteristics of these concentrations; and (iii) to evaluate how the geography of home and work influences the emergence of Chinese occupational niches. This project will contribute to the Census Bureau by improving the accuracy and reducing the costs of conducting the census. Three specific contributions can be mentioned. First, by identifying the many Chinese enclaves and examining the unique social and economic characteristics of each, the study will aid the preparation of estimates and characteristics of the Chinese population and minimize the problems of missed and inaccurately represented subpopulations during sampling. Second, this study will help the Census Bureau to design and appropriately target bilingual forms, provide telephone assistance and the telephone self-response options. By identifying and mapping both the residential locations and workplace locations of workers at census tract level, this study can facilitate the success of follow-up surveys and help reduce under/over counts. Finally, this study will help the Census Bureau in the development of a pilot study to over-sample the Asian population for Census 2010. For example, the results can be used to assess whether better estimates are to be gained from oversampling areas with high concentrations of the target (Chinese) population, or by over-sampling across a larger geographic area, albeit with smaller concentrations of the target population. The geographic patterns of Chinese concentrations can be correlated with patterns and rates of mail response to Census questionnaires to assess response rates. These benefits will help further the recommendations made by the Census Advisory Committee on the Asian Populations made as a result of the meeting on May 1, 2002.","How Does Geography Matter in Ethnic Labor Market Segmentation Process?

"An Empirical Assessment of the Value of Electronic Integration in the Manufacturing Sector","Manufacturers are increasingly using the Internet to electronically integrate their business processes internally and across their network of trading partners. However, due to a lack of available data sources, information about the adoption and economic impact of Internet business practices is limited. The proposed study seeks to address this shortcoming by analyzing a dataset containing 39 measures of computer net-work use within U.S. manufacturing plants collected within the Computer Network Use Supplement (CNUS) to the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM).  Additional datasets employed provide data on plant characteristics and efficiency for a period of multiple years prior to and beyond the CNUS year (1999), including the Census of Manufactures and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization. The sample of establishments responding to the CNUS accounts for roughly 50 percent of all manufacturing employment and salaries and 95 per-cent of online manufacturing cost of materials, with substantial variation in response rate by geography and plant size. Given that there may be systematic differences between respondents and nonrespondents, three approaches will be used to examine nonresponse bias. First, known differences in the samples (ASM characteristics such as value of shipments and employees) will be examined. For example, if CNUS respondents tend to be from plants that are on average 10 percent larger, I can estimate the nonresponse bias by estimating the impact of a 10 percent change in plant size on CNUS variables. Second, I will compare measures from an independent survey with those of the CNUS survey. Third, I will compare the response rate to an ASM question on the value of e-shipments as a percentage of all shipments with measures collected within the CNUS, as well as the profile of responding plants to the ASM question versus the CNUS question. Regarding parameter estimates, innovation variables will be computed using the 39 dichotomous items available from the CNUS.","Information Systems for Collaborating versus Transacting: Impact on Plant Performance in the Presence of Demand Volatility","Saldanha, Terence J., Nigel P.

"Wages and the Organization of Human Capital:  Legal Services 1977-1997","The purpose of this proposal is to examine the quality of the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 Census of Services data for legal services firms on payroll by occupation, to determine whether one can combine revenue and payroll data to infer partner compensation, and to assess whether the manner in which the Bureau collects the occupation and payroll data produces distorted estimates in its publications. We then plan to use the Census microdata to investigate how the organization of legal services – in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure – has changed over time, characterize the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyze relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly. The project will benefit Census programs in several ways. First, the project centers around the payroll by occupation data, which to our knowledge have not been used by CES staff. In the course of our project, we will learn the strengths and weaknesses of these data and communicate them to Census staff. These data have the potential to be a valuable resource to researchers investigating wage inequality, but if the responses to current questions are low-quality, the questions should either be changed or discontinued. Second, the Census has published estimates of the number of partners and associate lawyers for the U.S. and for select MSAs in recent Census years except 1997. These estimates have been somewhat misleading because they are based on definitions of “partners” and “associates” that differ from conventional uses of these terms in the industry. We plan to assess the magnitude of the distortion this produces, and create alternative estimates that are based on conventional definitions of “partners” and “associates.” Third, we would enhance the data we work with in two ways.

"Wages and the Organization of Human Capital:  Legal Services 1977-1997","The purpose of this proposal is to examine the quality of the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 Census of Services data for legal services firms on payroll by occupation, to determine whether one can combine revenue and payroll data to infer partner compensation, and to assess whether the manner in which the Bureau collects the occupation and payroll data produces distorted estimates in its publications. We then plan to use the Census microdata to investigate how the organization of legal services – in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure – has changed over time, characterize the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyze relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly. The project will benefit Census programs in several ways. First, the project centers around the payroll by occupation data, which to our knowledge have not been used by CES staff. In the course of our project, we will learn the strengths and weaknesses of these data and communicate them to Census staff. These data have the potential to be a valuable resource to researchers investigating wage inequality, but if the responses to current questions are low-quality, the questions should either be changed or discontinued. Second, the Census has published estimates of the number of partners and associate lawyers for the U.S. and for select MSAs in recent Census years except 1997. These estimates have been somewhat misleading because they are based on definitions of “partners” and “associates” that differ from conventional uses of these terms in the industry. We plan to assess the magnitude of the distortion this produces, and create alternative estimates that are based on conventional definitions of “partners” and “associates.” Third, we would enhance the data we work with in two ways. We would link them over time, and provide alternative estimates of the number of partners and associates at each individual establishment in our data. These augmented datasets would be available to Census researchers.","The Return to Knowledge Hierarchies","Thomas Hubbard & Luis Garicano, 2007.

"The Financial Assimilation of Immigrants","While most discussions of immigrant assimilation focus on labor and housing markets, immigrant participation in financial markets is a critical and largely unstudied dimension of economic assimilation.  The degree to which immigrants assimilate into the financial mainstream has profound implications for the U.S. economy. This project will provide new evidence on the extent of immigrant participation in financial markets and the key determinants of financial assimilation. The aspects of financial assimilation that will be studied include use of checking and savings accounts, participation in the stock market, and investment in risky vs. “safe” assets. The analysis will be based on data from the Survey of Income Program and Participation (SIPP). These data will be supplemented with characteristics of the countries of origin and with data on the destination communities. The predominant purpose of this project is to benefit the U.S. Census Bureau’s program, and it will do so in at least three ways. First, this study will com-pare SIPP data on immigrant year of arrival and country of origin to comparable data from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. Second, this study will analyze the factors that account for the higher attrition rate of immigrants relative to the native born in the SIPP panel. Finally, the project will produce population estimates of the pace of immigrant financial assimilation.","Crises and Confidence: Systemic Banking Crises and Depositor Behavior","Osili, Una Okonkwo, and Anna Paulson. 2014. “Crises and Confidence: Systemic Banking Crises and Depositor Behavior.” Journal of Financial Economics 111: 646-660.

"Hedonic Models of Real Estate and Labor Markets","The proposed research program will develop and implement methods to estimate hedonic price supply and demand models applied to two important classes of empirical economic issues where hedonic models are applicable, real estate and labor markets. Since these models include attributes that are highly location specific, this project will also develop and implement methods to link the micro-observations of Census Bureau datasets to micro-observations of other Census Bureau datasets and to external datasets. This linkage will be based on locations of the micro-observations, i.e., their physical geospatial proximity with each other, and will be performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These two activities, development of hedonic prices and geospatial linking, form the principal benefits to the Census Bureau. In addition, through the application of these models to specific topics of interest, we will also generate bene-fits to specific Census Bureau surveys, such as the American Housing Survey and other surveys used through the course of the project. In order to apply hedonic models to study location issues, datasets containing highly detailed geographic information and robust methods for establishing the geospatial relationships are required. The project will use GIS modeling tools to create the necessary statistical measures of collocation that will enable us to examine specific topics using the hedonic approach. In addition, part of the proposed research will develop new methodological approaches that address some of the theoretical and empirical shortcomings with the classical hedonic model. The topics that will be studied in this project include: an analysis of residential real estate markets; an analysis of school quality, education, location, and neighborhood effects; commercial real estate markets and community economic development; and a hedonic analysis of labor markets.  This research program is focused not only on developing the data sources and tools needed to apply the hedonic approach to these questions but also on testing our progress with a series of interrelated topical studies that focus on some of these aspects. While the longer term goal is a more integrated assessment of the hedonic values across all of these factors, we begin with examining several more “manageable” sized research topics in this general area by incrementally developing the data and tools needed to measure the aforementioned community factors and estimate the hedonic prices associated with them. In doing so we also expect to address some important social science research questions with better data and better methodology.","Impacts of Central Business District Location: A Hedonic Analysis of Legal Service Establishments","Limehouse, Frank F., and Robert E.

"Hedonic Models of Real Estate and Labor Markets","The proposed research program will develop and implement methods to estimate hedonic price supply and demand models applied to two important classes of empirical economic issues where hedonic models are applicable, real estate and labor markets. Since these models include attributes that are highly location specific, this project will also develop and implement methods to link the micro-observations of Census Bureau datasets to micro-observations of other Census Bureau datasets and to external datasets. This linkage will be based on locations of the micro-observations, i.e., their physical geospatial proximity with each other, and will be performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These two activities, development of hedonic prices and geospatial linking, form the principal benefits to the Census Bureau. In addition, through the application of these models to specific topics of interest, we will also generate bene-fits to specific Census Bureau surveys, such as the American Housing Survey and other surveys used through the course of the project. In order to apply hedonic models to study location issues, datasets containing highly detailed geographic information and robust methods for establishing the geospatial relationships are required. The project will use GIS modeling tools to create the necessary statistical measures of collocation that will enable us to examine specific topics using the hedonic approach. In addition, part of the proposed research will develop new methodological approaches that address some of the theoretical and empirical shortcomings with the classical hedonic model. The topics that will be studied in this project include: an analysis of residential real estate markets; an analysis of school quality, education, location, and neighborhood effects; commercial real estate markets and community economic development; and a hedonic analysis of labor markets.  This research program is focused not only on developing the data sources and tools needed to apply the hedonic approach to these questions but also on testing our progress with a series of interrelated topical studies that focus on some of these aspects.

"Temporary Help Industry and Local Market Conditions","The Help Supply Industry (SIC 7363) has been one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S. economy. It includes both Temporary Help Services (THS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a temporary basis, and Employee Leasing Services (ELS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a longer-term basis. Research on the industry has been growing because of the important role it is thought to have had in increasing labor market flexibility by efficiently matching workers and employers (e.g., Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997; Golden, 1996; Ono and Zelenev, 2003). However, the rapid growth of the Help Supply Industry also presents challenges for statistical agencies and the researchers who use their data. One concern is that while the workers supplied by THS and ELS establishments are under the direct supervision of the client firm, they are on the payroll of the Help Supply establishments. Thus, they are not counted in the employment totals of the industries in which they perform their work. This can make standard estimates of labor productivity misleading for industries that utilize help supply workers. In addition, most research interest is in the role of THS firms in improving the functioning of labor markets, but most available data do not distinguish between THS and ELS employment. This is a concern because ELS firms, which typically take on the payroll of an existing workforce and have little role in the recruitment of workers, are unlikely to play the same important labor market intermediation role as THS firms. This project will increase the U.S. Census Bureau’s knowledge base about the relevant issues surrounding the Help Supply Industry. Given recent growth in this industry and its likely impact on the productivity and investment decisions of firms outside the industry (the client firms), this information is extremely important for evaluating Census Bureau’s collection and tabulation of employment data. To examine these issues, this project will extend our previous work (Ono and Zelenev, 2003; Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997) with micro-level analyses of firms’ use of temporary labor and the industrial organization of the THS industry. First, by using the 1997 and 2002 Business Expenditure Survey (BES) and Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), we will analyze the extent to which THS usage buffers fluctuations in client firms’ regular employment. We will also examine whether the use of THS is increased by greater competition among THS agencies. Next, by using the Census of Services and Longitudinal Business Database, we will study whether THS agencies are attracted to local markets with more volatile industrial structures, using the method employed in Ono and Zelenev (2003). We then will examine whether the entry of THS agencies reduces the markup they charge client firms for supplying workers. Finally, we will study the role of temporary help services in the particularly important market for temporary nurses. This proposal will further benefit Census programs by using Census micro data to address data quality issues and to create documentation that will benefit the Census Bureau by increasing understanding of current problems in the data as well as by improving future data collection efforts. In particular, we will contribute to the development of methods to improve the separate estimation of the number of ELS and THS workers employed by each industry in each geographic area. This will require use of the economic census and the BES. We will also develop methods to incorporate the inputs of THS and ELS workers in estimates of industry level labor productivity in manufacturing. This will require use of the PCU, as well as other census datasets.","Professional Employer Organizations: What Are They, Who Uses Them and Why Should We Care?","Lombardi, Britton, and Yukako Ono. 2010. “Professional Employer Organizations: What Are They, Who Uses Them and Why Should We Care?” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-10-22.

"Vertical Linkages and Investment Decisions","This project will examine supplier-customer relationships (also known as vertical linkages) and the impact of these relationships on investment decisions. The Census Bureau has explicitly stated a need for “specific recommendations regarding how to better capture and describe supply chain activities in the 2002 Economic Census and in our current economic statistics” (Mesenbourg 2001). This project will develop a methodology to capture and describe these supply chain activities using internal Census economic microdata (Census of Manufacturing, Annual Survey of Manufacturing, Census of Construction, Longitudinal Business Database, Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) combined with Input-Output Tables of the American Economy compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and will provide this methodology to Census. In addition, knowledge gained from these analyses will be used to address several data quality issues in these data sets (i.e., studying patterns of non-response, developing new imputation methods, conducting consistency checks). The project will then use these relationship measures to examine firms’ decisions to adopt electronic commerce infrastructure based on their suppliers’ and customers’ actions as well as to examine capital investment decisions by ready-mix concrete plants based on downstream local construction activity. Hence, this project will not only benefit the Census Bureau by producing a methodology to capture and describe these supply chains but will also provide knowledge useful for addressing a multitude of data quality issues. Vertical linkages between firms play an enormous role in the functioning of the economy. A large fraction of output from plants across the country is not consumed by individuals but is utilized in other firms’ production processes. These linkages are key to explaining investment behavior -- if a firm’s customers are growing rapidly, it is apt to expand its operations to meet future demand. The two applications chosen for this project, enumerated above, have a guiding methodological principle: the use of information about the relationships between firms, either sectors that trade with each other in the case of e-commerce or concrete plants that sell neighboring construction projects, to understand why firms make capital investments. Since both applications of these projects study firm-level decisions, non-public Census data are required. This project will primarily use data from the Longitudinal Research Database (i.e., the longitudinally linked conjunction of the Census of Manufacturing and the ASM) but will also use data from the Census of Construction, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization.","Mergers and Sunk Costs: An Application to the Ready-Mix Concrete Industry","Collard-Wexler, Allan. 2014. “Mergers and Sunk Costs: An Application to the Ready-Mix Concrete Industry.” American Economic Journal: Microeconomics 6: 407-447.

"Workplace Hazards: Determinants and Economic Impacts","This project combines U.S. Census Bureau data with external information on workplace hazards to benchmark data consistency at the plant level, to model the determinants of those hazards, and to see how they affect economic performance at manufacturing plants. The relationship of hazards and plant data as reported will be investigated to learn if negative shocks to production resulting from accidents or catastrophes are accurately reflected in the data. We also examine the determinants of workplace hazards, based on a model of a profit-maximizing plant choosing an optimal level of hazard abatement, given the pressures it faces. These pressures include the expected fine from being cited by an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector for the workplace hazard. Unionization of the plant is expected to provide an incentive for hazard reduction, both from increasing worker knowledge about workplace hazards and from providing a framework in which to negotiate compensating wage differentials. Our models of wages, employment, investment, and productivity will help identify situations in which we would expect a plant’s economic variables to change dramatically (a new union contract or a new government safety regulation requiring substantial new investments), which we will compare to the time-series variation in the Census Bureau data that these external pressures are expected to influence. A better understanding of external factors (e.g., unionization and workplace hazards) influencing economic outcomes such as productivity will also be valuable to Census Bureau analysts and researchers to evaluate circumstances when data and estimate adjustments may be warranted due to temporary disruptions in plant production.","Randomized Safety Inspections and Risk of Exposure on the Job: Quasi-Experimental Estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life","Lee, Jonathan M., and Laura O.

Our models of wages, employment, investment, and productivity will help identify situations in which we would expect a plant’s economic variables to change dramatically (a new union contract or a new government safety regulation requiring substantial new investments), which we will compare to the time-series variation in the Census Bureau data that these external pressures are expected to influence. A better understanding of external factors (e.g., unionization and workplace hazards) influencing economic outcomes such as productivity will also be valuable to Census Bureau analysts and researchers to evaluate circumstances when data and estimate adjustments may be warranted due to temporary disruptions in plant production.","A Quasi-Experimental Approach to Identifying Compensating Wage Differentials for Occupational Risks","Lee, Jonathan M., and Laura O.

"Employment, Agglomeration, and the Spatial Sorting of Households and Firms","This research will estimate an empirical model that describes the decisions made by both households and ﬁrms within large, urban labor markets. The projects’ three main tasks are to estimate a model that describes household residential location choice and the employment status of household members, estimate a model describing the establishment location and employment decisions of ﬁrms, and conduct general equilibrium simulations using the estimated parameters from the two models. Analysis of the house-hold problem should provide new insights into the eﬀect of residential location on employment outcomes. The analysis of the ﬁrm problem is intended to examine the extent and nature of agglomeration economies within metropolitan areas, and the simulations that use the estimates from both models allow for an assessment of the general equilibrium eﬀect of changes in economic conditions on the patterns of individual and ﬁrm choices.","Race-Specific Agglomeration Economies: Social Distance and the Black-White Wage Gap","Ananat, Elizabeth, Shihe Fu, and Stephen L.

"Measuring Income and Poverty from a Multi-year Perspective","This project examines the value of supplementing official Census Bureau measures of poverty, income, and the income distribution with measures based on multiple years of income, potentially up to an individual’s entire lifetime. The research studies how perspectives of income inequality and the career paths of low-wage workers differ, when viewed from an annual and a lifetime perspective. It also analyzes how the distributional impacts of the Social Security system and the tax system (including the Earned Income Tax Credit) differ when viewed from a lifetime perspective rather than from an annual perspective. This research aims to produce a comprehensive analysis of the impact of government tax and transfer programs on the lifetime income distribution, incorporating components such as TANF and SSI not yet modeled from a lifetime perspective. This research will also analyze how a multi-year approach alters measures of poverty among the elderly. Finally, this research extends a micro-simulation model of the Social Security system to incorporate some limited behavioral responses.","Earnings Responses to Social Security Reform","Liebman, Jeffrey and Emmanuel Saez (2006). “Earnings Responses to Social Security Reform.” Mimeo.","2006","Boston",NA,"Liebman, Jeffrey and Emmanuel Saez","2006",NA

"Learning By Doing In New Plants: An Investigation","This project aims to enhance the utility of Title 13, Chapter 5 data by (i) linking the LRD with a comprehensive dataset of US patents; (ii) identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs, specifically with regard to innovation; and (iii) preparing estimates of learning, ‘spillovers’ in learning, and the impact of technological advance on productivity not contained in existing publications.
This project will further the U.S. Census Bureau’s objectives regarding the collecting and analysis of information on productivity and technological innovation and address some of the associated issues. This project will link two extensively used datasets—the LRD and the NBER Patent Dataset, a comprehensive dataset of all U.S. patents granted between 1963 and 1999—and provide a much richer picture of technological innovation than what can be obtained using R&D expenditures alone, which is the only measure of technological innovation currently available at the Census Bureau. Specifically, the study will use the linked dataset to develop a number of descriptive statistics regarding patenting behavior along the lines of the NSF R&D survey and compare them with the aggregate statistics in the NSF R&D survey.
The productivity estimates obtained using output-based (i.e., patent-based) innovation variables are likely to be significantly different from that estimated using input-based measures such as R&D expenditure. By providing comparisons of these detailed productivity estimates with “plain-vanilla” estimates, the results of the study will highlight the need for improvements in the current R&D survey or the need for a new innovation survey.
This project will produce a number of estimates of characteristics of the population that are not contained in existing publications. These estimates will be developed with two objectives in view—(i) to assess the extent of potential bias in productivity estimates due to ignoring the impact of learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation; and (ii) to provide a better understanding of the sources of productivity growth by decomposing productivity growth into that caused by learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation.
Specifically, the project will develop regression estimates of “labor learning” and “capital learning” by industry. Second, the analytical results will provide, by industry where possible, estimates of “spillovers” in learning within firms and across different firms, including the variation in the magnitude of learning “spillovers” with geographical proximity and locational characteristics. Third, the study will provide estimates of productivity growth decomposed into components caused by technological innovation, by learning, and by the interaction of innovation and learning. Finally, the study will create estimates of productivity differences from learning between (a) “survivors” and “non-survivors” and (b) between new entrants and existing incumbents diversifying into new industries.","NBER Patent Data-BR Bridge: User Guide and Technical Documentation","Balasubramanian, Natarajan, and Jagadeesh Sivadasan. 2010. “NBER Patent Data-BR Bridge: User Guide and Technical Documentation.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-10-36.

This project will further the U.S. Census Bureau’s objectives regarding the collecting and analysis of information on productivity and technological innovation and address some of the associated issues. This project will link two extensively used datasets—the LRD and the NBER Patent Dataset, a comprehensive dataset of all U.S. patents granted between 1963 and 1999—and provide a much richer picture of technological innovation than what can be obtained using R&D expenditures alone, which is the only measure of technological innovation currently available at the Census Bureau. Specifically, the study will use the linked dataset to develop a number of descriptive statistics regarding patenting behavior along the lines of the NSF R&D survey and compare them with the aggregate statistics in the NSF R&D survey.
The productivity estimates obtained using output-based (i.e., patent-based) innovation variables are likely to be significantly different from that estimated using input-based measures such as R&D expenditure. By providing comparisons of these detailed productivity estimates with “plain-vanilla” estimates, the results of the study will highlight the need for improvements in the current R&D survey or the need for a new innovation survey.
This project will produce a number of estimates of characteristics of the population that are not contained in existing publications. These estimates will be developed with two objectives in view—(i) to assess the extent of potential bias in productivity estimates due to ignoring the impact of learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation; and (ii) to provide a better understanding of the sources of productivity growth by decomposing productivity growth into that caused by learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation.
Specifically, the project will develop regression estimates of “labor learning” and “capital learning” by industry. Second, the analytical results will provide, by industry where possible, estimates of “spillovers” in learning within firms and across different firms, including the variation in the magnitude of learning “spillovers” with geographical proximity and locational characteristics. Third, the study will provide estimates of productivity growth decomposed into components caused by technological innovation, by learning, and by the interaction of innovation and learning. Finally, the study will create estimates of productivity differences from learning between (a) “survivors” and “non-survivors” and (b) between new entrants and existing incumbents diversifying into new industries.","Industry Learning Environments and the Heterogeneity of Firm Performance","Balasubramanian N. and Lieberman M., Industry Learning Environments and the Heterogeneity of Firm Performance, In K.

"Neighborhood Physical Form and Residential Satisfaction","The proposed research aims at testing whether and how the major components of neighborhood physical form—density, mixture in land use and housing, interconnectedness of street network—impose any systematic influence on residents’ perception and rating of their residential environment as a place to live, and how such influence would vary across household subgroups. It will employ multivariate statistic method to perform cross-sectional analyses. It will make use of the individual-level information from the publicly available 2002 metro-version American Housing Survey (AHS) data and neighborhood and community level social and physical measures derived from multiple data sources including the 2000 decennial census, the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP), and local parcel-based land use Geographic Information System (GIS) data. However, linking the AHS data to other datasets proposed to use in this research requires the census tract identifier, which is only available in the internal version of the AHS data. Given the current availability of the internal AHS datasets at the Center for Economic Studies (CES), the project proposes using the tract identifiers from the 1994/1995 internal AHS datasets for the 13 MSAs surveyed in the 2002 metro-AHS for the purpose of merging files. 
Funded in part by a dissertation research grant award by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the proposed research is anticipated to generate output that will not only inform policy makers but also benefit the U.S. Census Bureau in several areas. First, the proposed research will improve the understanding of the AHS data quality by conducting not only a careful examination of the AHS data itself but also an evaluation of the relationship between the AHS neighborhood measures and the neighborhood measures generated with other datasets. Second, analyses performed in this research will lead to potential improvement in data collection by identifying shortcomings in current AHS data collection and document new data collection needs, such as neighborhood attributes important to residential satisfaction but not currently surveyed in the AHS. Third, the resulting new dataset from merging the AHS with the neighborhood and community measures generated in this research will remain at the CES and be made available to other researchers. This new dataset will greatly enhance the utility of the AHS data in social science. And, fourth, the proposed research will yield summary statistics and coefficient estimates that go beyond those commonly released by the Census Bureau and enable a better understanding about Americans’ residential settings and residential experience.","A tale of two cities: physical form and neighborhood satisfaction in metropolitan Portland and Charlotte","Yang, Y. 2008.

"Individuals and Neighborhoods: A Reciprocal Relationship and its Consequences for Change over Time","This study will look at how neighborhoods change over time, how this change affects residents’ perceptions and actions, and how residents’ actions impact on the neighborhood change. Using longitudinal data, it will test two competing theories explaining the relationship between residential instability and crime rates in neighborhoods. I will also test whether the social capital in an area (embodied in social networks, voluntary organizations, and various other institutions) can ameliorate negative impacts on the neighborhood and prevent the downward spiral experienced by some neighborhoods. But to understand how neighborhoods change it is necessary to have an accurate measure of neighborhood quality. A key component of this study will be determining the usefulness of the subjective measures regarding neighborhood satisfaction, characteristics, and crime provided by respondents to the American Housing Survey (AHS) survey. I will combine a rich data set of measures culled from official sources with the AHS subjective responses in 21 metro areas as well as the three national neighbors subsamples (from 1985, 89, and 93). I am collecting a unique longitudinal data set of crime rates for small areas within particular cities. These data will allow me to assess the reliability of respondents to the questions about perceived crime. This will provide valuable information for future researchers who wish to use the subjective responses to the AHS for inferring the objective crime rates in neighborhoods. In addition, by linking in the official data I have collected with the AHS, I will be able to determine the sources of neighborhood satisfaction. This will provide insight if there are important neighborhood dimensions of neighborhood satisfaction that the AHS is not currently asking respondents, and provide guidance for future modification of the survey instrument.","Resident Perceptions of Crime: How Similar are They to Official Crime Rates?","John Hipp, 2007.

"The Going Public Decision and the Product Market","While an initial public offering is probably the most heralded mechanism of going public, the most common and successful mechanism of going public is, however, through an acquisition of the private firm by an existing public company. Since going public allows the firm to access external financing through the equity market for the first time in its life, going public may have important implications for the firm’s product market performance as well. In this research project, we will analyze (for the first time in the literature) how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision. This analysis will inform the U.S. Census Bureau regarding the behavior of organizational change activity and its determinants, where the timing of changes in ownership informs business register processing activity.  We also analyze the consequences of a firm going public on various aspects of its subsequent product market performance. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by Census Bureau programs.","IPO Waves, Product Market Competition, and the Going Public Decision: Theory and Evidence","Chemmanur, Thomas J., and Jie He. 2012. “IPO Waves, Product Market Competition, and the Going Public Decision: Theory and Evidence.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-12-07.

"Migration in the Arctic: Subsistence, Jobs, and Well-being in Urban and Rural Communities","The purpose of the proposed research is to increase the utility of U.S. Census Bureau data especially as it relates to understanding mobility of Arctic indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on Inupiat and other Inuit people. Our research proposes using decennial census long form data (1990, 2000) at the UCLA Census Bureau Research Data Center. In addition, as a part of our analysis, we will use data from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (2003), the North Slope Borough Census (1988–2003), the Government of Nunavut (1999, 2001, 2004), and Statistics Canada Aboriginal Peoples Survey (1991, 2001) along with the public U.S. Decennial Census PUMS and Census Summary Files 1–4 (1980–2000). 
In the Proposed Benefits section we outline how our research will provide the following direct benefits to the Census Bureau: 
(1) understanding and improving the quality of data produced through a Title 13 census; (2) enhancing the data collected in a Title 13 census; (3) identifying shortcomings of current data, collection programs, and/or documenting new data collection needs; (4) preparing estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13. Briefly, our research proposes the following: 
First, we compare household migration and social characteristic variables from other surveys with Census Bureau data. Active temporary migration, in combination with high rates of nonresponse, have contributed to suspect Census Bureau place-level data for certain variables in rural Alaska. Because of the uniqueness of questions in other survey instruments (such as temporary migration), we can test for differences in data quality, identify possible under-counts or overcounts, and suggest methods for improved remote rural enumeration. Second, we will improve the quality of data by estimating the effect of age, sex, and race imputation among large rural Alaska households (age and sex information for large Alaska households was lost due to a data capture error). Third, we use fitted values from private instruments to estimate the effect of nonresponse imputation in Census Bureau data. Fourth, we link private data sources with Census Bureau data to create a dataset, stored with the CRDC, which includes all Inupiat households living in the United States and additional Arctic place-level characteristics. Finally, we provide estimates of migration patterns within and between the Arctic regions of Alaska and the Canadian North. 
The proposed research on migration specifically addresses migration of Arctic indigenous people between rural communities, larger regional centers, and urban areas. We have three primary research objectives: (1) improve the utility of census data in order to more precisely document the economic and social characteristics of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) to refine and improve methods for analyzing migration decisions of individuals participating in mixed subsistence and cash economies in Arctic regions; 
(3) apply these improved methods to understand the particular migration behavior of the indigenous population in Arctic Alaska and Canada. 
We propose to address a number of questions about the causes and consequences of migration raised in previous studies. First, what are the roles of subsistence opportunities and community quality of life amenities in migration decisions? Second, how persistent and widespread are differences in migration patterns (such as gender differences)? Third, what can be said about the role of national policies regarding transfer income, education, and investment in community infrastructure on migration? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of migration decisions: is mobility on balance improving living conditions in Arctic communities, especially the poorest places, or is it draining leadership to larger settlements and exacerbating inequalities? Our approach views migration into and out of Arctic communities as a potential indicator of relative well-being for residents and takes into account subsistence opportunities and quality of life factors, as well as income earning opportunities. Our three levels of analysis include: i.) documenting patterns and stylized facts, ii.) testing community and regional differences, and iii.) applying a household production model to estimate well being by place. The model directly integrates subsistence opportunities into the migration decision and the estimated equations predict how changes in communities affect well-being directly and indirectly through their effects on migration. Comparing the Inupiat regions in Alaska to the Nunavut Territory of Canada in all three levels of analysis, we develop a demographic profile of migrants and migration rates over time and test hypotheses on the effect of changes in well-being on household migration decisions.","Migration in Arctic Alaska: Empirical Evidence of the Stepping Stones Hypothesis","Howe, E.

"Migration in the Arctic: Subsistence, Jobs, and Well-being in Urban and Rural Communities","The purpose of the proposed research is to increase the utility of U.S. Census Bureau data especially as it relates to understanding mobility of Arctic indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on Inupiat and other Inuit people. Our research proposes using decennial census long form data (1990, 2000) at the UCLA Census Bureau Research Data Center. In addition, as a part of our analysis, we will use data from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (2003), the North Slope Borough Census (1988–2003), the Government of Nunavut (1999, 2001, 2004), and Statistics Canada Aboriginal Peoples Survey (1991, 2001) along with the public U.S. Decennial Census PUMS and Census Summary Files 1–4 (1980–2000). 
In the Proposed Benefits section we outline how our research will provide the following direct benefits to the Census Bureau: 
(1) understanding and improving the quality of data produced through a Title 13 census; (2) enhancing the data collected in a Title 13 census; (3) identifying shortcomings of current data, collection programs, and/or documenting new data collection needs; (4) preparing estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13. Briefly, our research proposes the following: 
First, we compare household migration and social characteristic variables from other surveys with Census Bureau data. Active temporary migration, in combination with high rates of nonresponse, have contributed to suspect Census Bureau place-level data for certain variables in rural Alaska. Because of the uniqueness of questions in other survey instruments (such as temporary migration), we can test for differences in data quality, identify possible under-counts or overcounts, and suggest methods for improved remote rural enumeration. Second, we will improve the quality of data by estimating the effect of age, sex, and race imputation among large rural Alaska households (age and sex information for large Alaska households was lost due to a data capture error). Third, we use fitted values from private instruments to estimate the effect of nonresponse imputation in Census Bureau data. Fourth, we link private data sources with Census Bureau data to create a dataset, stored with the CRDC, which includes all Inupiat households living in the United States and additional Arctic place-level characteristics. Finally, we provide estimates of migration patterns within and between the Arctic regions of Alaska and the Canadian North. 
The proposed research on migration specifically addresses migration of Arctic indigenous people between rural communities, larger regional centers, and urban areas. We have three primary research objectives: (1) improve the utility of census data in order to more precisely document the economic and social characteristics of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) to refine and improve methods for analyzing migration decisions of individuals participating in mixed subsistence and cash economies in Arctic regions; 
(3) apply these improved methods to understand the particular migration behavior of the indigenous population in Arctic Alaska and Canada. 
We propose to address a number of questions about the causes and consequences of migration raised in previous studies. First, what are the roles of subsistence opportunities and community quality of life amenities in migration decisions? Second, how persistent and widespread are differences in migration patterns (such as gender differences)? Third, what can be said about the role of national policies regarding transfer income, education, and investment in community infrastructure on migration? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of migration decisions: is mobility on balance improving living conditions in Arctic communities, especially the poorest places, or is it draining leadership to larger settlements and exacerbating inequalities? Our approach views migration into and out of Arctic communities as a potential indicator of relative well-being for residents and takes into account subsistence opportunities and quality of life factors, as well as income earning opportunities.

"Industrial Structure, Agglomeration,and Productivity","This study will produce estimates of manufacturing productivity of businesses in U.S. regions that differ according to their industrial structure and agglomeration characteristics. Specifically, it will compare the production efficiency and realized agglomeration economies of business establishments in regions dominated by a few large firms with establishments in regions with a broad mix of firms and sectors. The substantive results are expected to yield insights into the forces driving regional economic growth and adjustment. The project will aid the U.S. Census Bureau’s mission by producing new estimates of productivity that account for the role of regional corporate structure, by developing and documenting procedures for linking Census Bureau data to Dun and Bradstreet MarketPlace data, and by evaluating the consistency of Census Bureau data with Dun and Bradstreet data. The project will link the MarketPlace data to the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and to the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). In the process of linking Census Bureau data to MarketPlace data, the project will create a documented crosswalk file that can be used in the future to link establishments in the MarketPlace data to those in Census data.

"Venture Capital Financing in Young Firms","
The primary purpose of this study is to enable the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand the role of venture capital (VC) financing in young firms and to improve the data collected in the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) and the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) by linking these datasets to an external dataset on VC financing. The researchers will suggest ways to improve the collection of information on VC financing and note any inconsistencies in variables across the Census Bureau datasets and the external data. The researchers will be the first to link the external dataset on VC financing (called VentureXpert) with the QFR and the SBO. The researchers will therefore create a bridge file that can be accessed by future users of these data. Finally, the researchers intend to empirically investigate important economic questions relating to VC. 
Using the SSEL Name and Address files from 1975 to 1999, the researchers will link VentureXpert to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) using a STATA coded name matching algorithm. The researchers will link the QFR (1982, 1987, 1992, 1997), and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners Survey (Firms and Owners) to the merged LBD-VentureXpert dataset using EINs and CFNs.

"The Mixed-Race Household in Residential Space: Proposal to Access 1990 and 2000 Decennial Long Form Data","The research has four goals that require use of the 1990 and 2000 long form data. First, we will test various definitions of mixed-race households using 2000 multiracial data with a view to maximizing compatibility for comparisons with 1990 single-race data. This testing will identify locations and scales where temporal comparisons are most sensitive to definitional issues in 2000. Second, we intend to map and analyze the neighborhood geographies of mixed-race households in 1990 and 2000. In light of concerns about disclosure risk for small populations in small areas, we are interested in developing procedures available for effective cartographic representations of mixed-race household geography that do not violate confidentiality protections. The third aim of the proposed research investigates the effect of increased rates of mixing within households on neighborhood segregation measures. The fourth aim of the proposed research centers on how racial identity is reported for the children of mixed-race couples.

"The Mixed-Race Household in Residential Space: Proposal to Access 1990 and 2000 Decennial Long Form Data","The research has four goals that require use of the 1990 and 2000 long form data. First, we will test various definitions of mixed-race households using 2000 multiracial data with a view to maximizing compatibility for comparisons with 1990 single-race data. This testing will identify locations and scales where temporal comparisons are most sensitive to definitional issues in 2000. Second, we intend to map and analyze the neighborhood geographies of mixed-race households in 1990 and 2000. In light of concerns about disclosure risk for small populations in small areas, we are interested in developing procedures available for effective cartographic representations of mixed-race household geography that do not violate confidentiality protections. The third aim of the proposed research investigates the effect of increased rates of mixing within households on neighborhood segregation measures. The fourth aim of the proposed research centers on how racial identity is reported for the children of mixed-race couples.

"Causes and Consequences of Neighborhood Economic Transitions","This project aims at improving understanding of neighborhood economic change by studying household residential choices and examining the circumstances under which households are willing to make moves into neighborhoods with incomes lower than their own. It will study whether and how these households diﬀer from house-holds making other types of residential choices and whether certain aspects of neighborhoods or their residents make such pioneering moves more attractive. The project will also investigate household exit decisions and examine whether mobility rates are higher in economically gaining neighborhoods. We will consider renters and low-income renters separately. The research will study other changes taking place in neighborhoods experiencing gains in income—such as whether housing costs increase and whether there are compensating changes in quality of the neighborhood, like increased satisfaction with neighbor-hood safety, schools, local transit, and availability of local businesses. The research will compare mobility rates and the prevalence of certain types of household turnover across different types of neighborhoods. A series of regression analyses will model pioneering moves, household exit, and various measures of household satisfaction by using the national and ﬁve metropolitan area versions of the American Housing Survey","How Low Income Neighborhoods Change: Entry, Exit and Enhancement","Ellen, Ingrid Gould & O'Regan, Katherine M., 2011.

"Plant Size and Plant Function","This project expands the notion of within-industry heterogeneity in plant size beyond variation in productivity to include variation in function. The main idea is that small plants tend to do different things than large plants; in particular, they specialize in custom work or retail-like activity that is often efficiently undertaken in small plants. This project studies the relationship between plant size and plant function by 1) constructing measures of dispersion across product lines within an industry across size classes; 2) looking for evidence that small plants engage in more custom and retail-like activity; 3) looking at variation in market areas within narrowly defined industries; and 4) determining the extent to which changes in the distribution of manufacturing establishments at a location parallel changes in the retail sector. The proposed project will bene-fit the U.S. Census Bureau through the tabulation of new statistics on the population of manufacturing establishments. These statistics will contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the industrial classifications used by the Census Bureau. The proposed analysis of industry definitions is of particular interest at this time because of the major shift from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) between the 1992 and 1997 Economic Censuses; this analysis will provide quantitative results on how the switch from SIC to NAICS affected the relationship between plant function and plant size within narrowly defined industries. In the longer run, the limitations of the industrial classification systems that we identify may aid in the design of future classification systems. The statistics tabulated in this project will also improve our understanding of the quality of the export data collected in the Census of Manufactures and Commodity Flow Survey (CFS); in particular, we will use the information in the CFS data to learn whether the well-known understatement of exports in the Census of Manufactures reflects a failure to correctly report export status or a failure to correctly report the value of exports.","An Alternative Theory of the Plant Size Distribution, with Geography and Intra- and International Trade","Holmes, Thomas J., and John J.

"Effects of CPS Topcoding on Labor Earnings and Income Inequality Estimates","In the United States, the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement is the primary dataset used to measure these earnings inequality.  However, over time U.S. Census Bureau survey and data storage decisions have changed the maximum value of income items reported from survey respondents. These limits were disproportionately restrictive in earlier years. Feng and Burkhauser (2005) argue that their loosening in later years is likely to have disproportionately impacted inequality levels and trends over time.  Despite these problems, we argue that even using only the public-use data, researchers can make sensible inferences with respect to levels and trends in inequality.  This project will apply both the non-parametric  and parametric approaches to the restricted-access CPS income data from 1975 to the present.  By doing so, we will better measure the income and earnings distributions. In particular, we want to see how the upper portions of these distributions affect the levels and trends of inequality measures such as the Gini coefficients. We will also evaluate the extent to which public-use data can be used to capture inequality levels and trends, using the approaches we pro-posed.  Most importantly, the study will allow us to detect the differences in measuring inequality using the public-use data and restricted-access data. This will increase the value of public-use data to the research community, while still preserving the confidentiality of the restricted access data.","Levels and Trends in United States Income and Its Distribution: A Crosswalk from Market Income Towards a Comprehensive Haig-Simons Income Measure","Armour, Philip, Richard V.

"Effects of CPS Topcoding on Labor Earnings and Income Inequality Estimates","In the United States, the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement is the primary dataset used to measure these earnings inequality.  However, over time U.S. Census Bureau survey and data storage decisions have changed the maximum value of income items reported from survey respondents. These limits were disproportionately restrictive in earlier years. Feng and Burkhauser (2005) argue that their loosening in later years is likely to have disproportionately impacted inequality levels and trends over time.  Despite these problems, we argue that even using only the public-use data, researchers can make sensible inferences with respect to levels and trends in inequality.  This project will apply both the non-parametric  and parametric approaches to the restricted-access CPS income data from 1975 to the present.  By doing so, we will better measure the income and earnings distributions. In particular, we want to see how the upper portions of these distributions affect the levels and trends of inequality measures such as the Gini coefficients. We will also evaluate the extent to which public-use data can be used to capture inequality levels and trends, using the approaches we pro-posed.  Most importantly, the study will allow us to detect the differences in measuring inequality using the public-use data and restricted-access data. This will increase the value of public-use data to the research community, while still preserving the confidentiality of the restricted access data.","Levels and Trends in U.S. Income and its Distribution: A Crosswalk from Market Income towards a Comprehensive Haig-Simons Income Approach","Armour, Philip, Richard V.

"A Firm and Plant-Level Analysis of Outsourcing: Sources of Productivity Growth and Heterogeneity","The proposed analysis takes two avenues by studying: (1) The industry and geographic heterogeneity in the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database, and (2) the sources of productivity growth for outsourcing organizations. For researching industry and geographic variation, economic concentration indexes and Locational Gini coefficients will be estimated for different geographic and industry measures. Economic concentration indexes and Locational Ginis provide a statistical measure of the geographic and industrial agglomeration of outsourcing. In addition, plant and firm intermediate input demand is estimated as a function of domestic variables in order to determine the importance of the different factors that drive an organization’s decision to outsource. In particular, estimated demand functions calculate the importance of domestic wages, trade costs, regulation, and technology in the context of the decision to outsource. The derived demand estimation is verified through a probit analysis of the determinants of an organization’s decision to outsource. The second avenue of research, the productivity analysis, entails estimating differences in exit rates and decomposing productivity growth between outsourcing and non-outsourcing organizations. Estimates will be provided from various specifications that capture the factors important in the agglomeration and productivity growth of outsourcing within the United States.","Offshoring Bias in U.S. Manufacturing: Implications for Productivity and Value Added","Houseman, Susan, Christopher Kurz, Paul Lengermann, and Benjamin Mandel. 2010.

"Ethnic Enclaves and Labor Markets","The goal of this research is to examine the relationship between Hispanic origin and race reporting and estimate how social networks associated with immigrant enclaves influence labor market outcomes. We will examine the effect of ethnic concentrations on both earnings and employment in several high-immigration states (California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas) using the 1-in-6 sample of the 1990 and 2000 U.S. census. The large number of observations in these samples allows us to focus on broad ethnic categories (e.g., South American and Mexican, East Asian and Pacific Islander, Southwest Asian and African, and European and Russian) as well as specific ethnicities (e.g., Mexican, Chinese, Indian, etc.) that cannot be analyzed with more readily available public-use data.  In order to analyze the enclave effect, we will estimate a series of individual-level wage (and employment) equations that control for years since migration, cohort-specific effects, and other observable human capital and demographic characteristics. Wage and employment equations will be estimated for each ethnic group and a measure that captures the proportion of the individual’s census tract that is populated by a particular ethnic group will be introduced into the model. The results of this study will provide an understanding of the relationship between race and ethnic information collected by the decennial census and will identify possible problems in cur-rent data collection strategies. In addition, the wage equations will provide valuable population parameter estimates of returns to observable human capital and social capital in immigrant communities.","A Warm Embrace or the Cold Shoulder?

"Job Availability and Employment","Kain’s classic paper on spatial mismatch argued that residential segregation reduces the equilibrium employment of minorities by increasing the distance to available jobs. While a substantial literature has emerged testing this hypothesis, and the more general notion that one’s distance to potential jobs might reduce employment probabilities, few studies have been able to deal adequately with the endogeneity of firm and worker location decisions. This project uses a natural experiment to infer the wage and employment effects of moving employers closer to an underemployed population. Using the federal Empowerment Zone program as an exogenous predictor of firm location, the project develops an instrumental variables approach to estimating the elasticity of labor supply with respect to job availability. The analysis will utilize data from the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses, the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSEL), and the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD).","Assessing the Incidence and Efficiency of a Prominent Place Based Policy","Busso, Matias, Jesse Gregory, and Patrick Kline. 2011. “Assessing the Incidence and Efficiency of a Prominent Place Based Policy.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-11-07 [RDC]","2011","Michigan",NA,"Busso, Matias, Jesse Gregory, and Patrick Kline.","2011",NA

"An Equilibrium Model of an Urban Housing Market: Identification, Simulation and Housing Dynamics","This project has four related components.  The first component continues research begun under our previous project at the Berkeley Research Data Center. At the heart of that project was the development of a general equilibrium model of an urban housing market, using an extensive dataset built around restricted-access decennial census data for 1990. In developing this framework further, we will focus on two areas—the identification of key parameters of the model using a boundary fixed effects approach and carrying out informative counterfactual simulations using the equilibrium model in conjunction with our parameter estimates.  The second component uses two waves of decennial census data, for 1990 and 2000, to study the effects of California’s Class Size Reduction Act on local housing markets. Our goal is to measure the size of the induced effects of the reform on household sorting across schools and neighborhoods before estimating the effects of such changes on school and student performance. The third component will make use of the rich cross-sectional data for 2000 to develop and estimate a matching model that describes how workers are matched to firms in equilibrium. And the fourth component will take advantage of the two waves of decennial census data for California (used in the second component of our proposed research) to estimate a dynamic housing market model.","Tiebout Sorting and Neighborhood Stratification","Bayer, Patrick, and Robert McMillan. 2011. “Tiebout Sorting and Neighborhood Stratification.” NBER Working Paper No. 17364.

"The Labor Market for Older Workers","This project will generate new information on rigidities in the labor market for older workers by using rich longitudinal survey data on individuals matched to employment data on the firms that employ them. The individual data are from the Survey of Program Participation and the employer data are from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics files. The aims of this project are to address the following issues: (1) What accounts for differences in the age structure of employment across firms? Why do some firms employ a larger proportion of older workers than others, and why do some firms hire a larger share of older workers than others? Do differences in the age structure of employment across firms indicate the existence of labor market rigidities? (2) How does the age composition of employment and hiring in a firm affect hours worked and the rate of exit from the firm of older workers relative to younger workers, both to other firms and to nonemployment, controlling for the effects of worker characteristics? (3) What are the main factors responsible for rigidity in the labor market and its differential effects on older relative to younger workers? The main alter-native explanations that can be analyzed with matched worker-firm data are technology-based—fixed costs of hiring, training, and employment; team production considerations; costly monitoring of worker effort; and firm-specific human capital. These explanations can be studied with matched worker-firm data because technology is firm specific, even within industries. The project will address these questions by estimating regressions models explaining labor market transitions of workers as a function of the age distribution of employment in their firms, con-trolling for worker characteristics. The project will also estimate structural equilibrium models of the labor market intended to explain variation in the age structure of employment across firms.","Framing Social Security Reform: Behavioral Responses to Changes in the Full Retirement Age","Behaghel, Luc, and David M.

"Understanding the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy","Measuring foreign trade in the United States, who trades, how it is conducted, where it originates, where it goes, and its impact on the U.S. economy is an important mission of the U.S. Census Bureau. A principal objective of the project is to build on prior work by linking additional years of import and export transaction data to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and enhancing the existing match of 1993 and 2000 data. The additional years to link are 1992, and 1994–1999 (with the hope of obtaining (and linking) additional years of data from the Foreign Trade Division). The links are made via the EIN information on the import and export transaction files to the Standard Statistical Establishment List files (SSEL) and for exports to Canada, the link is made via business name. We propose to investigate improved matching methodologies using enhanced statistical matching algorithms. 
With the additional linked data, the project proposes to examine a number of issues to increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of data collected in Title 13, Chapter 5 programs. The topical areas to be investigated include multinational corporation import and export pricing and valuation behavior, geographic and product market entry, the impact of trade on the domestic economy, and treatment of inventory in transit. The project requests the use of all economic census and survey data for the years 1963 through the most recent available (and future years as they become available), the SSEL files (including name and address information) for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the LBD for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the Foreign Trade Division import and export transaction data for 1992–2000 (and future years should they become available).

"Understanding the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy","Measuring foreign trade in the United States, who trades, how it is conducted, where it originates, where it goes, and its impact on the U.S. economy is an important mission of the U.S. Census Bureau. A principal objective of the project is to build on prior work by linking additional years of import and export transaction data to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and enhancing the existing match of 1993 and 2000 data. The additional years to link are 1992, and 1994–1999 (with the hope of obtaining (and linking) additional years of data from the Foreign Trade Division). The links are made via the EIN information on the import and export transaction files to the Standard Statistical Establishment List files (SSEL) and for exports to Canada, the link is made via business name. We propose to investigate improved matching methodologies using enhanced statistical matching algorithms.

"The Emergence of E-Commerce Usage and the Characteristics of Firm Structures and Operations","The blooming of e-commerce over the past decade has fostered a considerable diversity and complexity of structure, applications, and definitions. This project examines and evaluates the adoption and use of e-commerce across a diverse set of manufacturing firms.  It examines the Computer Network Use Supplement data on e-commerce gathered in the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and analyzes the characteristics of firms that are related to the use of e-commerce. The focus is on manufacturing because it is currently the sector in which e-commerce is most widely adopted.  The project examines the implementation of e-commerce across manufacturing industries and product types and focuses on how it con-tributes to firms’ competitive advantage through changes in value chains. The analysis is set in the context of how the material characteristics of firms (ranging from size to ability to adopt innovation) impact their medium to long-term viability. While this analysis masks the complex ways in which e-commerce is put to work by firms, this focus on the firm and firm-level characteristics is a first step in uncovering the larger changes at the firm and regional level engendered by e-commerce. This project will also inform the Census Bureau about the quality of the e-commerce data collected using the ASM, about new methods for collecting this type of data, and about the characteristics of firms that influence the probability that and the degree to which a firm will use e-commerce. The Census Bureau would then be able to use this information to further assess the quality of data reported as well as be able to update cur-rent methods for imputing missing data.","Manufacturing Solutions: Explaining E-Commerce Adoption in Manufacturing Firms","Leinbach, Thomas, Matthew Zook, and Candice Wallace. 2012. “Manufacturing Solutions: Explaining E-Commerce Adoption in Manufacturing Firms.” University of Kentucky mimeo.

"Neighborhood Change","We plan to link the AHS National files from 1985 to 2003 and the AHS Metro files from 1980 to 2003) to the confidential 1980, 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census long form data at the census tract level in order to investigate how rapidly ""neighborhoods"" (census tracts) change.  We propose to use census tract measures from 1980, 1990 and 2000 to identify neighborhood characteristics, such as the distribution of income, education and race within the neighborhood.  Linking this to American Housing Survey (AHS) data allows us to study the characteristics of in-migrants, out-migrants and stayers within different neighborhoods.","Who Moves to Mixed-Income Neighborhoods?","McKinnish, Terra, and T.

"From the Baby Boom: The Contraceptive Origins of Women","Since the release of the first birth control pill in 1960, women’s fertility and work decisions have undergone a dramatic transition. By the turn of the century, the high fertility rates and low participation of the Baby Boom had evolved into high employment and high childlessness. While recent work links oral contraception to changes in fertility and marital timing and changes in the labor-force participation rates of younger women, these studies do not explore the importance of oral contraception in reshaping the career and mobility decisions of young women. Moreover, research on the changing gender gap does not consider the significance of greater fertility control on inter-mediate mobility decisions and, by extension, longer term wage and employment outcomes. The relationship of each of these outcomes with fertility control are interesting per se, but they may also provide insight as to how women were successful in “swimming upstream” in times of rising wage inequality and why changes in the gender gap appear to have stagnated since 1990.  The proposed project will explore dimensions of career mobility that have been important to women’s economic advancement since 1968—the importance of interstate mobility in determining educational, occupational, and employment paths and labor-force outcomes; how the importance of mobility has changed over time; and how changes in women’s career mobility might be related to oral contraception.  The project uses the restricted access geographic identifiers both in the March Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature Women.  These data facilitate both a comparative and descriptive analysis as well as an experimental evaluation of the origins and nature of the second demographic transition and the quality and shortcomings of the Current Population Survey in light of these population changes.","Fifty Years of Family Planning: New Evidence on the Long-Run Effects of Increasing Access to Contraception","Bailey, Martha J. 2014. “Fifty Years of Family Planning: New Evidence on the Long-Run Effects of Increasing Access to Contraception.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 14-15.

"The Impact of Spin-out Generation on Parent and Progeny Firms","Spin-outs are distinct entrepreneurial ventures where founding team members are ex-employees of an incumbent ﬁrm. In many industries, spin-outs (progeny ﬁrms) compete directly with the incumbents (parent ﬁrms) and are an important source of innovation and growth. Previous research has emphasized the beneﬁcial performance implications of the knowledge diﬀusion from the parent to the progeny and have found that the inherited knowledge provides spin-out ﬁrms both superior capabilities and performance vis-à-vis other entrants. However, little is known about the competitive eﬀects of these knowledge ﬂows on the subsequent capabilities and performance of parent ﬁrms. This project will investigate the processes that generate ﬁrm births and deaths in general but also those that generate spin-oﬀ  births in particular. The research will identify new ﬁrms, spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms, and the parents of these new spin-oﬀ ﬁrms in the legal services industry. It will analyze the characteristics of these new ﬁrms as well as the parents of spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms. This process is especially interesting in the services sector where barriers to entry are generally low and ﬁrm birth and death rates are very high. As a result of this high turnover, it has traditionally been diﬃcult to accurately mea-sure new ﬁrm generation, the characteristics of new ﬁrms, and the performance of new ﬁrms in the services sector. However, with a custom Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) extract in conjunction with the external Martindale-Hubbell directory, this project will be able to accurately portray characteristics of new and dying ﬁrms as well as to estimate birth and death rates in this sector. Moreover, this project will develop and test new methodologies of spin-oﬀ generation and knowledge as well as examine the quality of the LEHD data in comparison to the Martindale-Hubbell data.","What Do I Take with Me: The Impact of Transfer and Replication of Resources on Parent and Spin-Out Firm Performance","Agarwal, Rajshree, Benjamin Campbell, April M.

"Teacher Quality and Wage Compression","There is great concern among educators, policymakers, and laypersons about the perceived decline in primary and secondary school teacher quality over the past 40 years. Though this issue has spawned substantial academic and policy research on the relationship between student outcomes and observable measures of teacher quality (such as educational attainment, experience, and SAT scores), the results of such studies remain far from convincing. This project investigates the hypotheses that: 1) pay is more compressed in teaching than in other, comparable occupations; 2) as a result, high quality teachers leave teaching at higher rates than low quality teachers; and 3) this has a measurable effect on student outcomes. The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, with its matched employer-employee wage data, is uniquely suited to this empirical investigation. The project will identify high quality teachers by their relative wages and the wage dispersion at their jobs after leaving a particular school district; this avoids many of the frequent criticisms found in the teacher quality literature. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) provides information on compensation and unionization policies in public schools in the states listed above; linked to the LEHD data this can establish the relationship between specific policies and wage compression. The Common Core of Data (CCD) provides basic information and descriptive statistics on all schools, their students, and their teachers; this information, linked to the LEHD, will provide many controls in the analysis and allow an investigation of student outcomes.","The Teachers Who Leave: Pulled by Opportunity or Pushed by Accountability?","Champion, Sara, Annalisa Mastri, and Kathryn Shaw. 2011. “The Teachers Who Leave: Pulled by Opportunity or Pushed by Accountability?” Stanford University mimeo.

Estimates will be primarily derived from multivariate models and will focus on the following six broad areas: employers’ decisions to offer insurance; employers’ decisions on the types of plans to offer employees; employees’ health insurance enrollment decisions; employers’ decisions on the structure of their contributions towards premiums; employers’ labor market responses to employer-sponsored health insurance; employers’ decisions with respect to health insurance eligibility rules.","The Health Insurance Status of Low-Wage Workers:  The Role of Workplace Composition and Marital Status","Jessica Vistnes and Alan Monheit, “The Health Insurance Status of Low-Wage Workers:  The Role of Workplace Composition and Marital Status.”  Medical Care Research and Review, April, 2011.","2011","Washington",NA,"Jessica Vistnes and Alan Monheit, “The Health Insurance Status of Low-Wage Workers:  The Role of Workplace Composition and Marital Status.”  Medical Care Research and Review, April,","2011",NA

"Real Investments and Managerial Career Concerns","This project examines how managerial career concerns, proxied by age, affect firm real investment policies. These career concerns can lead to distortions in the decisions to build or destroy plants since such decisions reflect on the ability of the manager to make good decisions. The researchers estimate logistic regressions to test whether managerial career concerns affect the probability of plant births, deaths, sales, and purchases. The research will also test the “trapped administrator” phenomenon where a manager who is afraid of losing her reputation is more reluctant to cease investments in unproductive plants which she built or acquired and may even try to increase the resources to these plants in order to prevent failure.  This project will prepare new tabulations of public firms managed by different demographic groups. To understand whether CEO age affects plant births and deaths, the investigators will tabulate the different investment projects against CEO age and also prepare tabulations relating the value of capital expenditures, value of shipments, and total employment to CEO age. The project will provide benefits through the production of population level estimates of plant births and deaths and by relating variation in these plant activities to managerial characteristics. Logistic models are used to relate CEO age and gender to the probability of various investment (or disinvestment) projects being undertaken. Additional estimates will show how managerial characteristics influence plant-level capital expenditures. These estimates of the impact of managerial age and other demographic variables are important as they shed light on how changing demographics can affect macroeconomic employment and productivity patterns.","Do Local Managers Give Labor an Edge?","Yonker, Scott E. 2013. “Do Local Managers Give Labor an Edge?” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 13-16.

"Patterns of Firm Expansion","This project explores issues of firm expansion. Those address the following: what factors determine the firms that will expand; the underlying reasons for expansion (e.g., efficiency vs. market power); the manner of expansion (intensive or extensive, acquisition or building new); the choice of whom to acquire, if that is the preferred expansion mode; and the impact on other players in the market, be they competitors or consumers. Focus is on expansion along the extensive margin, that is, through the purchase of existing establishments or the building of new ones. For data reasons, the project concentrates on manufacturing establishments, but some analyses will also be done for non-manufacturing sectors. The Longitudinal Business Database will be tied to production information from the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Sur-vey of Manufactures, and the Commodity Flow Survey. In its examination of firm expansion patterns, the project focuses on examining changes in linkages between establishments and firms during changes in owner-ship and on changes in establishment employment, payroll, and revenues as establishments and firms expand. Additionally, this project will inform the Census Bureau about supply chains within industries and how e-business impacts supply chain relationships.","Building New Plants or Entering by Acquisition?

"Patterns of Firm Expansion","This project explores issues of firm expansion. Those address the following: what factors determine the firms that will expand; the underlying reasons for expansion (e.g., efficiency vs. market power); the manner of expansion (intensive or extensive, acquisition or building new); the choice of whom to acquire, if that is the preferred expansion mode; and the impact on other players in the market, be they competitors or consumers. Focus is on expansion along the extensive margin, that is, through the purchase of existing establishments or the building of new ones. For data reasons, the project concentrates on manufacturing establishments, but some analyses will also be done for non-manufacturing sectors.

"Rising Health Care Costs: Effects on Labor Demand and Retiree Health Insurance Benefits","We propose to analyze the effects of health insurance benefit costs on employer demand for part-time employees, availability of retiree health insurance bene-fits, and the effects of unionization on health benefit offers and cost sharing arrangements by employers. To address these issues, we propose to use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) List Sample matched with the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and supplemental economic data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Area Resource File.   This project will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by contributing to the understanding of the quality of the data collected in the MEPS-IC by comparing variables reported by establishments and firms in MEPS-IC and the LBD (e.g., tenure/age of firm). This project will also look for variability in reporting by establishments of the same firm and will derive methods to address inconsistencies.

"Understanding Micro-Productivity Heterogeneity","Making an initial public offering (IPO) of equity, otherwise known as “going public,” is an important event in the life of a firm. In this research project, we will analyze how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision.  While the existing literature has documented that firms have poor operating performance (as measured by profits) in the years immediately after going public, the precise reason for this poor performance has not been previously addressed. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by U.S. Census Bureau programs.   In addition, public firms in general are under more scrutiny and monitoring by regulatory agencies than private firms because once a firm becomes public, it has to file its relevant information on a regular basis to the securities exchange and other regulatory authorities, and answer to its shareholders. Thus, the public financial disclosure requirement may strengthen the firm’s internal data collection and reporting, and this in turn may lead to a better response rate and better reporting quality to the surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. By identifying the public versus private status of establishments in the Census Bureau databases, we will also be able to analyze the data quality of these establishments prior to and after going public, and report if there are any changes in the quality of the data reported by various establishments after this change in public versus private status.","Productivity, Restructuring, and the Gains from Takeovers","Li, Xiaoyang. 2013. “Productivity, Restructuring, and the Gains from Takeovers.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 13-18.

"Telephone Penetration of Low Income Households","Telephone penetration—the percentage of households with telephone service—is the accepted measure of universal service in the United States. This research studies the telephone penetration of low-income households in the United States. One purpose of the study is to measure the determinants of telephone penetration of low-income households, including the effects of universal service policies that reduce the prices these households pay for telephone service. Another objective is to compare predictions generated by the econometric model with standard hotdeck imputations used to assign responses for households that do not respond to the telephone availability question. The study uses cross-section and panel econometric methods to estimate the demand for telephone service by low-income households. The explanatory variables are demographic and location characteristics, including the characteristics of the telephone service plans offered to low-income households. The econometric analysis estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service for different demographic groups. Predicted household demands are aggregated to explain the determinants of changes in telephone penetration of low-income households between 1990 and 2000. Predictions from the econometric model are compared to imputations from standard hotdeck methods used for dealing with nonresponses to the telephone availability question. The study estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service of different demographic groups and measures the determinants of changes in telephone penetration between 1990 and 2000, including the effects of universal service policies that reduced the prices low-income households pay for telephone service.","Estimating the Impact of Low-Income Universal Service Programs","Ackerberg, Daniel A., David R.

"Internal Migration to and Retention of the Foreign Born in non-Traditional Destinations","This research employs census long form sample and American Community Survey (ACS) confidential data to analyze the dynamics underlying the increasing dispersal of the foreign-born population in the United States. The project focuses on three dimensions of this process: 1) The estimation of the individual and context characteristics that underlie internal migration to nontraditional destinations; 2) The analysis of place and individual characteristics associated with both residential stability and residential churning for foreign-born persons residing in non-traditional destinations; and 3) The examination of the process of selection of destinations for those departing from nontraditional settlement areas. The analysis utilizes McFadden choice models to estimate the role of different destination contexts in attracting foreign born. Multilevel logit models estimate the processes of departure from gateway and nontraditional places. This project will enhance census and ACS data by generating knowledge on cohort residential trajectories between the 1980s and early 2000s. The research on destination choices will also provide a detailed picture of the migration links between specific types of places. In addition to describing the nature of these linkages, the research will shed light on the dynamics underlying emerging trends in the internal migration and settlement behaviors of the growing foreign-born population.","Will They Stay?

"Internal Migration to and Retention of the Foreign Born in non-Traditional Destinations","This research employs census long form sample and American Community Survey (ACS) confidential data to analyze the dynamics underlying the increasing dispersal of the foreign-born population in the United States. The project focuses on three dimensions of this process: 1) The estimation of the individual and context characteristics that underlie internal migration to nontraditional destinations; 2) The analysis of place and individual characteristics associated with both residential stability and residential churning for foreign-born persons residing in non-traditional destinations; and 3) The examination of the process of selection of destinations for those departing from nontraditional settlement areas. The analysis utilizes McFadden choice models to estimate the role of different destination contexts in attracting foreign born. Multilevel logit models estimate the processes of departure from gateway and nontraditional places. This project will enhance census and ACS data by generating knowledge on cohort residential trajectories between the 1980s and early 2000s.

"Starting School at Four: The Effects of Universal Pre-Kindergarten on Children and Mothers","Publicly subsidized universal prekindergarten (pre-K) pro-grams have received consider-able attention in recent years as an avenue for both promoting school readiness and providing child care. In this study we will estimate the effects of Pre-K programs on children’s enrollment in preschool and on the labor supply (e.g., hours worked and wages) and welfare receipt of mothers. Each program has an age cutoff for enrollment. The methodology will employ exogenous differences in eligibility across states and from these age restrictions to create ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ groups which will be used to determine program effects. The dataset used will be the 2000 confidential decennial long form sample. The project will produce valuable estimates for use in an academic journal article. Better understanding of family behavior regarding work and child care produced by this project will allow for insight that could change the way the Census Bureau asks its questions regarding early childhood education and care.","Revising Our Thinking about the Relationship between Maternal Labor Supply and Preschool","Fitzpatrick, Maria Donovan. 2012. “Revising Our Thinking about the Relationship between Maternal Labor Supply and Preschool.” Journal of Human Resources 47: 583-612.

"Firm Innovation, Knowledge Spillovers, and Productivity Growth","This study characterizes the innovative and entrepreneurial efforts of firms in the U.S. economy. It begins with a detailed analysis of the R&D-to-patenting inventive process and further delineates how this innovation translates into within-firm productivity growth and across-firm knowledge spillovers. It also considers how U.S. national and local governments influence these rates of innovation and entrepreneurship and firm entry more generally. These innovative forces will be finally linked to concomitant technological change, productivity growth, and changes in industrial structure. Specific topics addressed include immigration admissions of foreign-born scientists and engineers, labor market regulations, federal funding of R&D undertaken in private firms, government-backed loans to entrepreneurs and small businesses, banking and financial market structures and regulations, foreign direct investments by multinationals, and patent and trademark laws. Detailed firm-level and establishment-level data are employed to pair a firm’s R&D and patenting efforts with its productivity out-comes, for considering federal support of R&D at the firm-level, and for looking at knowledge spillovers from a research-oriented firm to other businesses within the firm’s state or industry.

"Innovative Activity and Organizational Change: Private versus Public Status and Acquisitions","This project studies innovation and research and development in the spirit of Schumpeter where innovation and research and development (R&D) are part of the process of creative destruction in the economy. Using data on both public and private firms, it examines how firm organization changes following innovation that is initiated by itself, or by firms in its own upstream and downstream industries. It also studies the impact of firm organization on the exploitation of R&D expenditures and patents. The central premise of this study is that organizations adjust to industry technological change as both additional research and the development of ideas after patents require extensive organizational and financial resources. It focuses on two types of organizational adaptations: the decision to be private or publicly listed and changes in firm boundaries through mergers and acquisitions. Firms differ in the extent of their operations across multiple industries. Some firms choose to be focused and produce in single industries. Other firms produce in multiple industries. The central question is the extent that these two dimensions are significant in explaining which firms conduct and then commercialize research and patent activity. This project will provide evidence on the importance of research and the development of that research in determining the boundaries of the firm by examining three different aspects of innovative activity. These include patent activity, patent citations, and R&D expenditures.","Private and Public Merge Waves","Maksimovic, Vojislav, Gordon Phillips, and Liu Yang. 2013. “Private and Public Merge Waves.” Journal of Finance. 68(5):2177-2217.","2013","Washington",NA,"Maksimovic, Vojislav, Gordon Phillips, and Liu Yang.","2013",NA

"Mechanisms behind Higher Mobility Rates among College Graduates","This project uses detailed longitudinal information from all waves of the National Longitudinal Surveys to examine lifecycle migration patterns across education and gender groups.  It extends earlier work examining the causal role of a college education in subsequent geographic mobility to answer the important questions of why and how college going increases long distance mobility.  Educational differences in migration primarily occur between the college educated and everyone else.  The project studies gender differences in lifetime migration patterns, particularly the manner in which these have evolved across cohorts.  Migration patterns for women may have changed along with the dramatic increase in education and labor force participation that women experience over the latter half of the twentieth century.  The research involves two stages. The first employs longitudinal data to construct complete migration histories of a representative sample of U.S. residents. The second stage builds on the first, using information in the migration histories to test ideas about which mechanisms explain the different rates of long distance moves across education and gender groups.","Job Changing and the Decline in Long-Distance Migration in the United States","Molloy, Raven, Christopher L.

The research involves two stages. The first employs longitudinal data to construct complete migration histories of a representative sample of U.S. residents. The second stage builds on the first, using information in the migration histories to test ideas about which mechanisms explain the different rates of long distance moves across education and gender groups.","Declining Migration within the U.S.: The Role of the Labor Market","Molloy, Raven, Christopher L.

"Productivity, Supply Chain Structure, and Information Technology Investment: Investigating Endogenous IT Investment by Firms","This research project links recent survey data on the digital economy with other Census Bureau datasets and with proprietary data to understand how productivity, supply chain structures, and investment in information technology (IT) are coevolving in the U.S. manufacturing sector.  It investigates the drivers of firm IT investment that are likely to be endogenous in standard models of how IT affects firm behavior. The primary outcome of this research and main benefit will be more accurate and more-nuanced estimates of firm populations that invest in IT, as well as insights into the characteristics and distributions of these different subpopulations in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Another central outcome will be an assessment of the quality and consistency of existing census data on the digital economy. Directly linking and comparing datasets, as well as improving the Census Bureau’s under-standing of the interaction between IT, the infrastructure needed to support e-business, and evolving supply chain relationships in the U.S. economy, will reveal observable patterns in nonresponse, highlight inconsistencies across surveys and years, verify the stability of important empirical relation-ships across time, and suggest ways to improve future surveys.","Decentralization versus Centralization in IT Governance: It's Not as Simple as You Might Think","McElheran, Kristina Steffenson. 2012.

"Interfirm Job Mobility, Local Labor Markets, and Organizational Dynamics in Retail","American public opinion reﬂects a growing concern about employment stability and a weakening of the bond between employer and employee. Less stability means more frequent interﬁrm job changes that can result in interruptions in company beneﬁts (especially health insurance), decreases or stagnation in wages, and involuntary entry into contingent or temporary employment relations. This project examines interﬁrm mobility by introducing locality into an analysis of the retail industry. Job mobility is best gauged with measures of the dynamic characteristics of firms as they function in their local context. At the organizational level, workers in locally oriented retail business establishments exhibit different mobility pat-terns than their counterparts employed in non-locally oriented ﬁ rms. This research seeks to analyze the inﬂuence of local organizational and labor market dynamics on interﬁrm mobility of workers, examine the mobility of workers in locally oriented and non-locally oriented ﬁrms with special attention to times of economic expansion and recession, and explore the direction of interﬁrm mobility in terms of earnings stability, appreciation, or depreciation over time.","Local Manufacturing Establishments and the Earnings of Manufacturing Workers: Insights from Matched Employer-Employee Data","Tolbert, Charles, and Troy Blanchard. 2011.

"Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing:  Phase 3","This project extends the time frame and scope of the projects Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing: Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. Those projects successfully implemented the methods described in prior project proposals for a few selected industrial sectors. This project will continue to expand the scope of phases 1 and 2 via additional industry specific analysis. The principal analytic approach is the application of the frontier production function. The project will enhance the Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding the specific area of investigation, which is the distribution of energy output ratios specifically and in relationship to the distribution of total factor productivity.

By using this statistical technique, we hope to provide the Census Bureau with estimates of the eﬀect of military service on the veteran population purged of selection bias. These estimates will demonstrate how Vietnam-era males, chosen randomly through the draft lottery, compare with the nonservice population on variables such as income, wealth accumulation, marital stability, and residential mobility.

Speciﬁcally, it will estimate the impact of loan access on the following outcomes: diﬃculty paying rent and utilities, eviction, termination of utilities due to default, delay of needed health care, and household debt. The measure of loan access, geographic proximity to payday loan stores, depends upon fairly detailed information on house-hold location (census tract and county), necessitating access to nonpublic geographic identiﬁers in the SIPP. By investigating a determinant of economic well-being among low-income individuals, this project fulﬁlls one of the Census Bureau’s goals in conducting the SIPP: to provide improved measures of economic well-being.

"Pollution Abatement Expenditures and Outcomes: Internal and External Determinants","This project seeks to improve the understanding and the quality of the plant-level data on environmental spending collected in the Census Bureau’s Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey. The project combines PACE data with other Census Bureau datasets and with external data to model the impact of pollution abatement spending on economic factors, such as the plant’s production costs and productivity, as well as its pollution emissions. The research will test accuracy of reported abatement expenditures by modeling their impact on total factor productivity levels, which should decrease productivity on a one-for-one basis if abatement activities contribute nothing to production. It also models the plant’s production function, testing whether the productivity of speciﬁc types of inputs are more seriously aﬀected by pollution abatement activities. Analyses include tests for differences across plants in abatement costs and in their impact on productivity, based on plant size, age, and other observed characteristics. The project will also model the impact of reported abatement costs on a variety of business decisions, including shifts in economic activity and investment, providing an indirect test for the reality of abatement costs. The project will beneﬁt the Census Bureau in several ways. The PACE survey has been recently resumed after an extended hiatus, so information about its data quality and comparisons to data from earlier versions of the survey are valuable. Our models of the impact of reported PACE spending on productivity and emissions test their validity in two ways: are they costs, and do they abate pollution? Our external datasets provide information on production technology and material use that will be used to assess the quality of comparable Census Bureau-collected information. Finally, the external datasets (particularly the Environmental Protection Agency’s Facility Registry System) provide care-fully maintained name-address, latitude-longitude, and plant ownership data that will provide information about the quality of the comparable Census Bureau information and how quickly that information is updated.","Do the Job Effects of Regulation Differ with the Competitive Environment?","Gray, Wayne, and Ronald Shadbegian. 2013. “Do the Job Effects of Regulation Differ with the Competitive Environment?” In Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, edited by Cary Coglianese, Adam M.

The project will also model the impact of reported abatement costs on a variety of business decisions, including shifts in economic activity and investment, providing an indirect test for the reality of abatement costs. The project will beneﬁt the Census Bureau in several ways. The PACE survey has been recently resumed after an extended hiatus, so information about its data quality and comparisons to data from earlier versions of the survey are valuable. Our models of the impact of reported PACE spending on productivity and emissions test their validity in two ways: are they costs, and do they abate pollution? Our external datasets provide information on production technology and material use that will be used to assess the quality of comparable Census Bureau-collected information. Finally, the external datasets (particularly the Environmental Protection Agency’s Facility Registry System) provide care-fully maintained name-address, latitude-longitude, and plant ownership data that will provide information about the quality of the comparable Census Bureau information and how quickly that information is updated.","Environmental Regulation and Product Mix: Evidence from the Census of Manufactures","Aaron A.

"Pollution Abatement Expenditures and Outcomes: Internal and External Determinants","This project seeks to improve the understanding and the quality of the plant-level data on environmental spending collected in the Census Bureau’s Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey. The project combines PACE data with other Census Bureau datasets and with external data to model the impact of pollution abatement spending on economic factors, such as the plant’s production costs and productivity, as well as its pollution emissions. The research will test accuracy of reported abatement expenditures by modeling their impact on total factor productivity levels, which should decrease productivity on a one-for-one basis if abatement activities contribute nothing to production. It also models the plant’s production function, testing whether the productivity of speciﬁc types of inputs are more seriously aﬀected by pollution abatement activities.

"Imports and Productivity in U.S. Manufacturing","The measurement of foreign trade ﬂows—imports and exports—is an important component of the information the Census Bureau collects on the overall U.S. economy. The research will bring data from these two programs together to provide more extensive characterization of foreign trade activity in U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms and variation in ﬁrm productivity. The project will prepare estimates of the relationship between productivity and how ﬁrms organize production with a particular focus on the role of trade and foreign sourcing in the supply chain. This project will also produce estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and growth in productivity and ﬁrm size. The project will contain analyses that serve to assess the quality of data collected on the supply chain in the 2002 Economic Census. The project will address whether productivity level determines the organizational form of the ﬁrm and whether importing leads to productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing or if higher productivity leads to imports. By estimating models of productivity growth that take the impact of both import and export behavior into account, this research will provide new, enhanced estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and productivity and how such relationships might vary with ﬁrm characteristics and industry. Estimates will also be produced of the relationship between ﬁrm growth (employment and revenues), imports, and exports. Accurate estimation of such relationships is an important tool to be used in the consideration of how trade liberalization will impact businesses and the economy. The results will also provide empirical evidence regarding the hypothesis that imports play a relatively insigniﬁcant role in productivity growth.","Export Prices of U.S. Firms","Harrigan, James, Xiangjun Ma, and Victor Shlychkov. 2011. “Export Prices of U.S. Firms.” NBER Working Paper No. 17706.

"Trade, Globalization, and the Enterprise-Establishment Relationships of Multinational Companies","This project examines the impact of trade and globalization on U.S. businesses. The project has three objectives. It will study the regional impacts of rapidly growing U.S. foreign exports of services by developing estimates of exports of services at the state level. It will examine the impact of globalization by U.S. multinational companies through direct investment, trade, and the oﬀ -shoring of services on the U.S. economy. It will examine the relationship between an enterprise and its establishments and explore methods of allocating enterprise-level data to establishments in various industries. All three components of this project will involve supplementing data collected at the Census Bureau on U.S. business activities with data collected at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the operations of multinational ﬁrms and on trade in services. Most Census Bureau business data are collected at the establishment level, while BEA’s surveys are conducted on a consolidated business enterprise basis. Linking these datasets greatly increases their analytic value by allowing questions about decisions made at the enterprise level—such as where to locate production to serve foreign customers—to be examined using the establishment-level data best suited to answering them. This project will build on previous projects that have linked Census data with BEA enterprise data. These previous linking projects have provided beneﬁts to the Census Bureau, and this project will expand on these beneﬁts. For example, it will enable the Census Bureau to improve its sample frames, verify and improve the accuracy of data reported on its surveys, and improve the industry classiﬁcations of enterprises and establishments. In addition, it will greatly increase the utility of the Census Bureau datasets for examining the impact that globalization—in the form of direct investment and trade in services—is having on the U.S. economy.","Foreign Direct Investment Relationship and Plant Exit: Evidence from the United States","Ibarra-Caton, Marilyn. 2012. “Foreign Direct Investment Relationship and Plant Exit: Evidence from the United States.” Bureau of Economic Analysis Working Paper WP2012-1.

"Place, Race/Ethnicity, and Entrepreneurship in the Global Era: A Comparative Analysis","This study investigates how place, race, and ethnicity intertwine to produce the spatial division of ethnic enterprises in different types of metropolitan areas in the U.S.—established immigration gateways versus newly emergent immigration destinations. The project uses the Survey of Business Owners (SBO), Business Register, Longitudinal Business Database, and Decennial Long Form data to address the following questions: (1) what are the characteristics of ethnic entrepreneurs and ethnic enterprises and how do they differ by group and by region, and (2) how are ethnic minority owned enterprises socially and spatially embedded in each urban context, and (3) what are the impacts of place on the presence and performance of ethnic enterprises. This project will benefit U.S. Census Bureau programs by an investigation of variation in survey nonresponse in the SBO across ethnic groups (sampling frames), across economic charac­teristics of firms, and across geographic areas. Thus this study will increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of the SBO data, help improve imputations for nonresponse, and potentially help improve the sampling frame for the SBO. The study will also aid the preparation of estimates and characteristics of the Hispanic and Asian sub-group populations and help minimize problems of missed and inaccurately represented subpopulations in the decennial census. Results from this project will help the Census Bureau to design and appropriately target bilingual forms, provide telephone assistance and telephone self-response options, and will thereby improve the accuracy and reduce the costs of conducting the census.","Industrial Concentration of Ethnic Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses in the United States","Wang, Qingfang. 2013. “Industrial Concentration of Ethnic Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses in the United States.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 13-34.

"Older Workers' Displacement and Mobility","This project will compute novel statistics useful in the analysis of older workers’ mobility and retirement decisions using individual data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with indices created from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure microdata. It will create refined employment opportunity indices based on detailed characteristics of the potential retirees. Currently available statistics, such as the LEHD’s Quarterly Workforce Indicators, provide detailed statistics by simple characteristics of the workforce, such as gender and age. This project will include additional characteristics in the computation of the employment opportunity indices. These include the respondents’ previous industry specific employment experience, the retirement decisions of similarly experienced individuals, and the mobility decisions of similar individuals. There would be three new types of indices: (1) a “job matrix,” which captures the geographic mobility patterns in employment; (2) a “mobility matrix,” which captures residential geographic mobility; and (3) an “opportunity index,” which is a person-specific convolution of these two matrices. The observed job mobility patterns of LEHD individuals, and in particular of older workers, will be used to estimate industry mobility patterns of recently hired workers at a detailed geographic level of work locations, the job matrix. The critical research issue is to determine the level of integration at which the new indices will be combined with existing data to produce a model estimation and forecasting framework. The observed geographic mobility of both LEHD and HRS individuals will be used to compute migration patterns of older workers and recent retirees to new residence locations, the mobility matrix. The mobility matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s residence at any point in time) can be used to weight the job matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s current or previous job characteristics), thus obtaining a person-specific job opportunity index, which is then incorporated into the relevant model. The utility of the proposed new indices, at the detailed and the aggregate level, will be assessed in a model-based framework.

"Firm Performance Effects of Broad-based Employee Stock Ownership","This project examines whether broad-based equity-based incentives are eﬀective at aligning incentives and the potential costs associated with providing these incentives. If employee ownership provides appropriate incentives, worker productivity should be higher and employee turnover should be lower. However, employee ownership also gives employees voting rights, which can be used to extract employee beneﬁts at the expense of other stakeholders in the ﬁrm. For example, workers with voting rights may be more successful at obtaining above-market wages or in delaying or preventing layoﬀ s or plant closures.

"Resettlement and Well-Being of New Orleans Residents after Hurricane Katrina","This project employs data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to examine the current location and well-being of residents of New Orleans in the year after Hurricane Katrina struck the city. The aims of this project are to describe the return or resettlement in the year following Hurricane Katrina of people who resided in New Orleans before the storm and to examine the well-being of the pre-Katrina New Orleans population in the year after the hurricane, compared to a matched population from the prior year. The ACS data provide a unique opportunity to examine the geographic dispersion of New Orleans residents throughout the United States in the after-math of Hurricane Katrina and to assess several important dimensions of well-being. This project addresses a number of unanswered research questions about the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans’ population. It also explores the strengths and weaknesses of the ACS data for examining the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina and for future studies of the effects of large-scale natural and man-made disasters. The researchers will evaluate the suitability of propensity-score reweighting techniques for studying these topics using the ACS by, for example, examining which population groups are underrepresented and overrepresented between the two ACS cross-sections.","The Location of Displaced New Orleans Residents in the Year after Hurricane Katrina","Sastry, Narayan, and Jesse Gregory. 2012. “The Location of Displaced New Orleans Residents in the Year after Hurricane Katrina.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-12-19.

"Minority Migrant Dispersal Over Five Decades","This research evaluates migration processes associated with race-ethnic redistribution—both across and within large U.S. metropolitan areas over the period 1970–2000—to detect tendencies toward greater minority dispersal. The last 3 decades have shown a dramatic rise in the size and diversity of the nation’s race and ethnic minority populations, but they have also shown these populations to be quite unevenly distributed across metropolitan areas as well as within them. The concentration of Hispanic and Asian populations in New York, Los Angeles, and a few other large metropolitan areas is related to their recent immigrant status and attachments to coethnic communities in those areas. Yet, recent Census 2000 results suggest their greater geographic dispersal. The African-American population, while less concen­trated than these groups, has shown an increased tendency to relocate in the South, revers­ing a long-standing movement in the reverse direction. Within metropolitan areas, all three groups are more concentrated in central cities and selected inner suburb communities, than non- Hispanic Whites. Yet, all three have shown tendencies toward greater suburbanization, which have been more apparent in growing metropolitan areas that are attracting more minorities. The migration processes underlying these inter-metropolitan, and intra-metropolitan minority redistribution patterns will be evaluated in this study using the 1970–2000 decennial censuses and the American Community Survey. The study will assess the extent to which these migration processes are leading to a greater dispersion of race and ethnic minorities both across and within large metropolitan areas.","Migration and Dispersal of Hispanic and Asian Groups: An Analysis of the 2006-2008 Multiyear American Community Survey","Frey, William H., and Julie Park. 2011. “Migration and Dispersal of Hispanic and Asian Groups: An Analysis of the 2006-2008 Multiyear American Community Survey.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-11-33.

"Microfoundations of Aggregate Labor Demand for Skill","This project uses the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and human capital ﬁ les to better understand how workforce and production aggregation choices aﬀect estimates of labor demand for skill and inﬂuence our understanding of recent changes in wage inequality. Decompositions of changes over time in employment and wage shares of skill and demographic groups, formal modeling and estimation of labor demand parameters, and correlations between demand and indicators of technology, capital, and trade from public-use datasets will be performed. These estimates will be generated at distinct levels of aggregated producer data: establishment, detailed industry, industry group, and economy-wide. The results will be used to reconcile microeconomic and macroeconomic trends in the wage structure and help evaluate competing explanations for the evolution of wage inequality.","Educational Attainment and Earnings Inequality among US-Born Men: A Lifetime Perspective","Mitchell, Josh. 2014. “Educational Attainment and Earnings Inequality among US-Born Men: A Lifetime Perspective.” Urban Institute Research Report.

"Offshore Outsourcing and the Effects on Plant- and Firm-Level Operations in the U.S. Manufacturing Sector","This project will involve a reduced form analysis of the final outcome of outsourcing, including sales and employment changes. It investigates outsourcing’s effects on prices and price-cost margins within the plants of outsourcing firms. Finally, it tests the hypothesis that offshore outsourcing decisions are driven by profit maximization. These effects and relationships are examined using U.S. Census Bureau data (Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Business Register, and the Auxiliary Establishment File), merged with Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Compustat North America information on outsourcing and a range of firm-level characteristics. Research on the effects of offshore outsourcing will provide benefits to both the Census Bureau and its pro­grams in three significant areas. The analysis of the correlation between census plant death dates and TAA plant closing data will make available new information on and improved census capabilities in both measuring and predicting plant deaths. The research on offshore outsourcing necessitates the creation of a bridge between TAA data and census business datasets. Through linking census data to previously unavailable TAA variables, such as employee layoffs and plant closing dates, this bridge enhances census data. Lastly, the research will estimate the effects of offshore outsourcing on various plant-level characteristics, such as sales and employment and within-firm prices and price-cost margins.","Domestic Gains from Offshoring?

"Agglomeration Effects: The Role of Selection","This research investigates the extent to which ﬁrm learning and selection account for observed geographic agglomeration eﬀects. A vast literature documents positive relationships between the wages and productivity of ﬁrms and various measures of agglomeration, eﬀects that persist even after control-ling for a broad array of worker, ﬁrm, and other local area characteristics. In many cases, researchers attribute the positive observed eﬀects of spatial agglomeration on diﬀerent outcome variables as evidence of agglomeration economies, suggesting that there may be knowledge spillovers or externalities associated with the geographic clustering of economic activity. This project explores the role of selection in explaining observed agglomeration eﬀects using the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD provides detailed geographic classiﬁcations that permit construction of measures of agglomeration at ﬁne geographic levels. This research will shed light on the sources of observed agglomeration eﬀects, the drivers behind diﬀerential rates of ﬁrm turnover and economic growth across geo-graphic areas, and the potential ramiﬁcations of policies aimed at encouraging or discouraging clustered business activity. This work will also yield a number of benefits to the Census Bureau by identifying shortcomings of existing data and methodologies, as well by improving the quality and utility of the data through longitudinal editing and the preparation of new population estimates.","The Urban Density Premium across Establishments","Faberman, R.

"The Role of Industry Classification and Firm Structure in the Estimation of Research and Development Expenditures","This project will reclassify the estimates of research and development (R&D) performance in the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) from ﬁrm-based industries to establishment-based industries using a consistent industry classiﬁcation (NAICS) for the entire time series of the SIRD. The research will convey beneﬁts to the Census Bureau along three dimensions by producing estimates of R&D using establishment-based industry codes; by conducting data quality assessments of the SIRD data, which exploit the longitudinal nature of the data; and by analyzing ﬁrm-establishment relationships. The Census Bureau is currently in the process of a major redesign of the SIRD, so the insights gained from this project will be particularly timely in contributing to the improvement of the future versions of the SIRD. The project will make an important contribution to the Census Bureau’s eﬀ orts to classify economic information on an establishment basis by identifying the establishments within each ﬁrm that are most likely to perform the ﬁrm’s R&D. Identifying these establishments within each ﬁrm will also substantially improve the Census Bureau’s eﬀ orts to accurately measure economic activity within states because many R&D-performing companies have establishments in more than one state.","The Role of Industry Classification in the Estimation of Research and Development Expenditures","Awuku-Budu, Christian, and Carol A.

"Internal Corporate Governance and Plant-Level Productivity","This project will investigate how internal corporate gover­nance, measured by the quality of headquarters’ monitoring of individual plants, affects plant productivity and other plant-level attributes. The plant-level data used in this project are obtained from the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database. The researchers will develop two measures of internal corporate governance. The first measure is the distance (physical distance or traveling time) between headquarters and individual plants. The second measure for the quality of monitoring is the “industry closeness” between the plant and headquarters. This measure reflects the idea that headquarters understands better, and thus finds it easier to monitor, a plant that operates in an industry with which headquarters is familiar. Plant productivity will be measured by total factor productiv­ity, operating margin, and labor productivity. Three main types of regressions will be estimated. The first type of regression looks at the direct (cross-sectional) relationship between productivity and internal corporate governance. The second type of regression examines whether the productivity gains (or losses) after a change of ownership can be explained by the difference in internal cor­porate governance. The third type of regression investigates if and how internal corporate governance amplifies (or mitigates) plant-level productivity shocks (state labor laws, natural disasters, oil and electricity shocks, opening of airports and golf courses in a neighborhood of the plant). Finally, plant-level measures of internal corporate governance will be aggregated into firm-level measures of internal corporate governance (e.g., the “weighted average distance” between headquarters and the firm’s plants) that can be used to investigate the role of internal corporate governance at the firm level (e.g., for equity prices or the conglomerate discount).","Capital and Labor Reallocation within Firms","Giroud, Xavier, and Holger M.

"Dynamic Models of Reallocation","Reallocation can take several forms, such as greater investment in more productive plants, entry of plants using a newer technology such as mini-mills, or exit of plants exposed to international trade. Economists care about reallocation at the plant level because of its role in generating improvement in aggregate productivity. In contrast to previous work on reallocation, this project will explicitly model the forward-looking choices of firms. When a firm decides to open a new ready-mix concrete plant, or shut down a steel mill because of foreign competition, it does so because it’s expectation of the net present value of profits are greater than the cost of either shutting down the plant or opening a new one. This project is composed of several separate subprojects designed to look at the forward-looking choices made by firms in different industries and how these generate reallocation. Changes in the ownership of establishments and establishing longitudinal links for firms over time will be used to evaluate the quality of the Master Business Register. The proposed analysis of changes in productivity will inform the quality of measurement of inputs and outputs in the economic census. In addition, several new estimates will be produced that relate to measurement error in productivity and the economic mechanisms driving reallocation of production towards more efficient units. This study will document the role of reallocation and entry and exit in shaping the productivity dispersion in the ready-mix concrete sector, as well as the role of measurement error of output and inputs in economic census questionnaires. Changes in the ownership of plants will be examined to identify the quality of Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) in census data. Since multi-plant ownership is associated with lower exit rates, the ownership of plants matters. This project will provide insight into the decision of firms to sell off assets, as well as the entry and exit decisions of firms rather than plants. It will analyze the effect of trade on plants in the textile and steel sectors. These sectors have been exposed to substantial changes in the strength of international competition over the last 30 years, due principally to the elimination of tariffs and quotas. This analysis will shed light on how the trade environment affected the speed of reallocation of resources such as employment and physical capital across plants in these sectors of the economy and whether this resulted in aggregate productivity gains. Prices of imported steel and textiles will permit the researchers to decompose changes in sales to changes in both the price and quantity produced.","Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the U.S. Steel Industry","Collard-Wexler, Allan, and Jan De Loecker. 2015. “Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the U.S. Steel Industry.” American Economic Review 105: 131-171.

"Impacts of trade on wage inequality across U.S. regions: analysis using matched employer-employee data","Wage inequality has increased rapidly in the US since the late 1970s. Imports to the US, especially those from low-wage developing economies, have risen over the same period. Standard trade theory links these trends and provides one explanation for the rise in relative wages of more skilled workers. However, most empirical studies have failed to find a strong connection between  trade and wage inequality. Most of these studies use unreliable proxies for skill and ignore related characteristics of workers and businesses that influence wages. We remedy these failings with matched employer-employee micro-data.

"Measuring Uncertainty Over the Business Cycle","This project investigates the role of variations in the level of uncertainty as a key driver of the business cycle. The most important piece of this research is construction of time series measures of uncertainty. This project is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau on four issues. One, the project will help to improve the quality of data produced by the Census Bureau. By constructing measures of volatility from census micro datasets and comparing these with external measures of volatility, the likely extent of measurement error in the census datasets can be evaluated. Two, it will lead to an improved methodology for tabulating aggregate statistics derived from census data. The analysis will aim to highlight the significance of time variation in the dispersion of establishment-level data. The project would then lead to a recommendation to display aggregate variances at yearly intervals. Three, it will help to prepare estimates of nonresponse over the business cycle that are driven by fluctuations in volatility. To estimate changes in volatility over the business cycle, changes in data imputation must be controlled for in the analysis.

"Measuring Uncertainty Over the Business Cycle","This project investigates the role of variations in the level of uncertainty as a key driver of the business cycle. The most important piece of this research is construction of time series measures of uncertainty. This project is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau on four issues. One, the project will help to improve the quality of data produced by the Census Bureau. By constructing measures of volatility from census micro datasets and comparing these with external measures of volatility, the likely extent of measurement error in the census datasets can be evaluated. Two, it will lead to an improved methodology for tabulating aggregate statistics derived from census data. The analysis will aim to highlight the significance of time variation in the dispersion of establishment-level data. The project would then lead to a recommendation to display aggregate variances at yearly intervals. Three, it will help to prepare estimates of nonresponse over the business cycle that are driven by fluctuations in volatility. To estimate changes in volatility over the business cycle, changes in data imputation must be controlled for in the analysis.

"Changes in Firm Pension Policy: The Case of Cash Balance Plan Conversion","This study investigates the determinants of private pension plan conversions from traditional defined benefit plans to hybrid cash balance plans during the 1990s. It examines whether there are systematic differences in the types of firms and plans that converted. It also examines the endogenous rela­tionship between the likelihood of conversion (on pension plan type, in general) and employee turnover. The project utilizes data from several sources for this analysis. Information on pension plan characteristics comes from the annual 5500 forms which most private sector firms file each year in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). From the PBGC also comes information on plan terminations. These data are linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, which provide information about establishment-level characteristics of the workforce. Firm level data from Compustat provide several important firm-level characteristics. The research intends to improve the link between the Form 5500 data and the Business Register. It will also compare data from the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Surveys to Form 5500 data in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset in studying firm human resource policies. It will also establish evidence on the determinants of employer provided pension plan policy changes and provide estimates of population characteristics relating to changes in employer provided pension plan coverage rates.","Changes in Firm Pension Policy: Trends Away from Traditional Defined Benefit Plans","Kapinos, Kandice. 2012. “Changes in Firm Pension Policy: Trends Away from Traditional Defined Benefit Plans.” Journal of Labor Research 33: 91-103.

"Using Establishment-Level, Longitudinal Data to Examine the Effect of Emissions on Health Outcomes","Exposure to environmental emissions may be an important determinant of health outcomes, but it is difficult to obtain scientific evidence on this point given the infeasibility of conducting randomized experiments. This research examines the relationship between emis­sions and health outcomes using establishment-level data in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and linked establishment-level surveys (the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Census of Mining, the Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities, and the Census of Wholesale Trade) merged with publicly-available information about emissions. The research design will exploit the precise record of establishment openings and closings in the LBD to identify effects on health outcomes. The first objective of this project is to evaluate the accuracy of establishment openings and closings in the LBD by merg­ing the LBD with establishments in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The second objective of the project is to generate new estimates of the effect of indus­trial emissions on human mortality. The U.S. Census Bureau’s National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) is a database designed for studying the effects of demographic and socio-economic characteristics on mortality rates. The estimates will help realize the objective of the NLMS, helping the Census Bureau better understand the role of environmental factors as a determinant of human mortality, as well as to better understand the extent to which industrial emissions have been a confounding factor in existing studies of mortality using the NLMS.","Do Housing Prices Reflect Environmental Health Risks?

"Corporate governance, managerial replacement and firm performance: Evidence from plant-level data","The project will merge the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM/LRD), and Census of Manufacturers (CMF/LRD) databases with the SDC Platinum database provided by the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) to assess the quality of merger and acquisition information in Title 13, Chapter 5 Census data, and to investigate investment and productivity changes surrounding managerial successions. Senior management turnover events are typically followed by operational changes as well as asset restructurings, such as plant sales and acquisitions. Matched information from SDC will allow us to identify plants that change hands around the time of turnover in the management team, and to track factor productivity for both the sold and the remaining assets. We will study managers' incentives to divest underperforming assets, and whether better corporate governance leads to more timely and efficient management replacement decisions. We will also explore long-run trends in corporate governance, investment, and firms' organizational structures.
We will estimate the overall change in plant performance, as measured by total factor productivity (TFP), following managerial turnover. We will also use the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) to examine if the financial position of the firm improves following management change, and what the interplay between changes in TFP and changes in firm financial performance might be. Detail drivers behind any pre- and post-turnover performance changes will be explored, such as plant factor efficiency, employment changes using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD-ECF/QWI) data, plant utilization from the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), asset sales, including the sale of plants or segments of the firm, capital investment from the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), research and development investment from the Research and Development (R&D) survey, or the acquisition of other plants as captured in the LBD and Ownership Change Database (OCD). Census and SDC files will be linked using the Compustat-SSEL bridge file, the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL-NA), and the LEHD bridge files (BRB/GAL). Firms' asset management decisions affect various measures collected in Census Bureau data programs, including measures of investment and the purchase and sale of establishments and other firms. This project will inform Census program staff of underlying mechanisms that drive the values of reported measures, and the extent to which Census data programs capture firms' organizational changes. Variation in the quality of Census data on merger and acquisition activity is expected t+H264o be related to firm characteristics, such as acquisition ownership share, firm size, legal form of organization, and family ownership. We will explore if misreporting of acquisition activity is related to information uncertainty due to the duration of time elapsed between when an acquisition is announced and when it is completed, and discrepancies between the expected date and actual date as reported in the SDC data.","Does Financing Spur Small Business Productivity?

"Analysis of the Child Care Market in the United States","Early childhood activities such as preschool and day care have been receiving considerable attention in recent years as avenues for providing child care and promoting school readiness. In part, this is because female labor force participation has changed dramatically in recent decades, fostering interest in the role of children in female decisions about work. This research project studies the child care market in the United States. It links existing datasets to create a unique resource for examining the supply and demand of child care, the labor market for child care workers, how parental decisions about investments of resources (such as labor supply, fertility and education) interact with decisions about child care, and how government involvement (e.g., through regulation and funding intervention) affects the market for child care.

"Exploring Determinants of Manufacturing Establishment Performance","This research project aims to improve the quality of U.S. Census Bureau data and to increase knowledge about the determinants of manufacturing establishment performance. These objectives will be accomplished by linking an external dataset of establishments receiving business assistance between 1999 and 2007 to census datasets. The project uses the external dataset of business assistance recipients to both validate and improve the quality of census data. The data will be used to identify limitations of the census sampling frame, measure data quality, estimate nonresponse bias, and improve imputations for nonresponse in census datasets. The business assistance dataset is valuable because it contains data at the same level of resolution and contains some of the same data elements as census datasets. The project uses the linked datasets to explore determinants of establishment productivity not currently measured in census datasets. Specifically, the research explores how manufacturing establishment performance is affected by business assistance and how the effects vary across measurable dimensions. The analysis focuses on business assistance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership between 1999 and 2007. The project employs a variety of econometric approaches, primarily relying on an instrumental variables approach to estimate how measures of establishment performance such as productivity, output, and employment growth are affected by different types and levels of business assistance. Access to the census datasets is required to provide a valid control group and to provide key performance and control variables for this analysis.","Evaluating the Impact of MEP Services on Establishment Performance: A Preliminary Empirical Investigation","Ordowich, Christopher, David Cheney, Jan Youtie, Andrea Fernández‐Ribas, and Philip Shapira. 2012. “Evaluating the Impact of MEP Services on Establishment Performance: A Preliminary Empirical Investigation.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper CES-12-15.

"The Human Factor in Corporate Restructuring Decisions","This study analyzes the link between the characteristics of firms’ labor forces (the human factor) and corporate restructuring decisions, such as plant closure and acquisitions. Specifically, it will analyze whether the labor composition and the wage structure of a plant or firm affects its probability of being shut down or of becoming a takeover target, and how factors such as experience, human capital, and wages explain the cross-sectional differences in worker retention decisions and firm performance following an acquisition or plant closure. The project uses employee information from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, firm-level information from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), financial data from Compustat and information on corporate restructuring from the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions database. Additional data on manufacturing industries includes plant-level information from the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures to construct sharper estimates of changes in plant-level productivity around restructuring events. The project will evaluate the consistency of various databases maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyze the implications of any inconsistencies on census published statistics. Accurate information on corporate restructuring is especially important for time series and worker statistics, such as those produced by the LEHD program. Moreover, since the SDC data documents the time when restructuring becomes effective in the legal sense and census databases record the time when real changes are made (in terms of labor and capital), comparing these two sources will provide valuable information on the length of the integration process. Statistics on the changes in workforce composition and the change in the wage distribution after restructuring will be produced. Econometric models will estimate the effects of employee characteristics and the wage distribution on the likelihood of plant closure or takeover.","The Bright Side of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Internal Labor Markets","Tate, Geoffrey, and Liu Yang. 2015. “The Bright Side of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Internal Labor Markets.” Review of Financial Studies 28: 2203-2249.

"Synthetic Data Generation for Small Area Estimation","Sample surveys are a crucial source of information about the state of public health and people’s quality of life. Moreover, they provide an efficient way to identify and monitor illness and disability trends and track progress toward achieving the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Health Protection Goals. Increasingly, this information is being demanded in the form of small area statistics to monitor health trends and support policy decisions in small geographic areas, including those that are typically underrepresented in large-scale data collection projects. However, the CDC is often prevented from releasing small area identifiers in public-use datasets because the data do not satisfy certain disclosure restrictions. This research tests and evaluates a new method for generating public-use micro-level datasets that contain enough geographical detail to permit small area estimation without compromising the confidentiality of survey respondents. The method uses the observed survey data to fit a statistical imputation model that generates synthetic data records, which comprise the public-use data records. The synthetic data are generated to emulate the observed data and preserve important statistical properties of the observed data. Moreover, the synthetic data can account for the hierarchical clustering structure associated with multiple levels of geography; thus, permitting data users to perform various geographical analyses with a single dataset. Confidentiality protection is greatly enhanced because no actual data values are released to the public. The proposed methodology is tested and evaluated using confidential data from the National Health Interview Survey. Synthetic versions of this data source will be generated for key variables relevant to national health objectives. Various parametric and non-parametric imputation models capable of handling different variable types will be investigated.","Nonparametric Generation of Synthetic Data for Small Geographic Areas","Sakshaug, Joseph W., and Trivellore E.

"The Displacement Costs of Workers: Evidence from the Clean Air Act Amendments and the LEHD","Recent studies have found a significant relationship between environmental regulation and job loss. However, little is known about those affected by regulation induced job separation, including the significant costs incurred by those displaced. Several authors, including the EPA, have stressed the importance of accounting for adjustment costs of environmental mandates. However, little work has been done in this area, mostly as a result of limitations involving data. I plan to use the very rich administrative data of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics file to explore transitional impacts of the Clean Air Act Amendments of the 1990's. With the data, I will be able to provide robust estimates as to unemployment duration and long term earnings losses associated with increased air quality mandates. The richness of the data also allows me to examine whether regulation induces job transfer within or across industries. This project will provide the first estimates as to the adjustment costs associated with transitioning into a more stringent environmental regime.","The Transitional Costs of Sectoral Reallocation: Evidence from the Clean Air Act and the Workforce","Walker, W.

"Returns to Scale in U.S. Manufacturing and Construction Establishments","This project uses establishment-level data to estimate returns to scale in U.S. manufacturing and construction firms. Understanding how the degree of returns to scale shapes the production of investment goods will be instrumental for the U.S. Census Bureau to understand establishment-level data. Constructing a comprehensive panel of manufacturing firms and estimating production functions can identify the degree of returns to scale at the establishment level. Regressing output on factor inputs will deliver the degree of returns to scale. Prices for equipment and structure investment behave very differently which suggests differential technologies and returns to scale. To pay special attention to that difference, the Census of Construction Industries is used to contrast construction firms to manufacturing establishments. This project benefits the Census Bureau by correcting for measurement error, imputing capital stock for manufacturing establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures, seasonally adjusting older (annual) Plant Capacity Utilization data, and estimating capacity utilization for a large population of manufacturing plants that is not covered at present. This project will also deliver a precise estimate of the degree of returns to scale that is free from aggregation bias. This information is very relevant by helping to assess two competing theories of macroeconomic fluctuations. Understanding the source, nature, and transmission of fluctuations will not only advance the insight in the field of fluctuations but will also have neighboring fields in economics.","Disentangling Labor Supply and Demand Shifts Using Spatial Wage Dispersion: The Case of Oil Price Shocks","Kehrig, Matthias, and Nicolas Ziebarth. 2013. “Disentangling Labor Supply and Demand Shifts Using Spatial Wage Dispersion: The Case of Oil Price Shocks.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 13-57.

This project benefits the Census Bureau by correcting for measurement error, imputing capital stock for manufacturing establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures, seasonally adjusting older (annual) Plant Capacity Utilization data, and estimating capacity utilization for a large population of manufacturing plants that is not covered at present. This project will also deliver a precise estimate of the degree of returns to scale that is free from aggregation bias. This information is very relevant by helping to assess two competing theories of macroeconomic fluctuations. Understanding the source, nature, and transmission of fluctuations will not only advance the insight in the field of fluctuations but will also have neighboring fields in economics.","Slow to Hire, Quick to Fire: Employment Dynamics with Asymmetric Responses to News","Ilut, Cosmin, Matthias Kehrig, and Martin Schneider. 2015. “Slow to Hire, Quick to Fire: Employment Dynamics with Asymmetric Responses to News.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 15-02.

"Should My Car Move or Should We? An Intra-Household Model of Residential and Commuting Choices","Empirical evidence shows that family members bargain over nondurable household consumption decisions. It stands to reason that they also bargain over more longstanding decisions such as modes of transportation. In order to gain a better understanding of congestion, one must consider both the interplay between residential and commuting mode choices, and how those decisions are made within the family. Using data from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), this research develops a joint model of family residential choice and commuting method. It aims to make four key contributions to the literature. First, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, this work is the first to explicitly model both residential and commuting choices together using nationwide, individual level data.  Other research controls for distance to the head of household's job in a residential choice model but focuses on Tiebout sorting in housing markets, not commuting decisions. Second, the model does not treat households as unified decision making entities. This research uses the collective household model to improve upon the current residential choice literature, which treats multi-person households as single agents. Third, the framework here allows for an additional empirical test of the hypothesis that the collective model accurately approximates household behavior. Finally, the ultimate goal of this work is to conduct simulations that predict the land use impacts of congestion pricing and other transportation strategies. These simulations can be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of these strategies.","Should My Car Move or Should I?

"Evaluating and Enhancing the MEPS IC as a Source of Information on Employer Health Insurance Offerings","This project will develop links between the MEPS-IC and the MEPS-Household Component (MEPS-HC), as well as between the MEPS-IC and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics Individual Characteristics File (LEHD-ICF). These links will be constructed for the years 1996–2004 and will enhance the data by examining nonresponse to MEPS IC and evaluating possible methods to impute MEPS-IC variables that are not currently included in imputation procedures. Currently, the procedures for imputing missing or invalid values exist only for variables included in the MEPS-IC published estimates because developing these procedures requires resources. In the process of constructing the linked data sets, comparisons will also be made across these three nationally representative datasets: the MEPS IC, the MEPS HC, and the LEHD-ICF. This project will prepare estimates that model establishment offers of insurance, take-up rates, plan choice, total premiums, and employer premium contributions as a function of establishment and workforce characteristics. The researchers will examine multivariate models and bivariate associations to determine whether these newly imputed variables (e.g., percent over age 50) are predictive of these outcomes. They will evaluate the usefulness of the newly imputed variables in producing new estimates. They will also examine newly linked LEHD-ICF variables (e.g., race, citizenship and education) to see if they are predictive of outcomes of interest. This will provide evidence of the potential value of adding these new variables to the MEPS IC survey. This project will inform the U.S. Census Bureau about both employer behavior and also the linked behavior of employers and their employees with respect to the following topics: the effect of current tax subsidies on employer sponsored insurance, the revenue effects and incidence of reforms that cap tax subsidies, the effect of “tax price” on establishment and worker behavior, and the effect of reforms on establishment and worker behavior.","Employer-Sim Microsimulation Model: Model Development and Application to Estimation of Tax Subsidies to Health Insurance","Miller, G.

"Income Effects in Labor Supply: Evidence from Census Demographic Microdata","This research project uses timing of childbirth to measure the income effect of taxes on parents' labor supply. The IRS Residency Test states that families can claim a dependent for the entire fiscal year if the child was born at any time during the year, and therefore provides an exogenous source of variation in tax liabilities for births that occur late in the year versus those that occur early the following year. By measuring the difference in earnings in the subsequent year for parents of December and January births, we can identify the impact of a one-time non-labor income shock on parents' labor supply since both groups face on average the same future stream of tax rates after birth. Preliminary results using public-use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and cross-sectional data from the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that a temporary increase in after-tax income leads to a significant decrease in mothers' earnings with an estimated income effect of -0.9. This calls for a better understanding of the income effect of taxes of earnings, an important parameter that has not been studied carefully in previous work.  Restricted data from the 2000 Census Long Form and the ACS can alleviate the shortcomings of the current public-use datasets: coarse information on date of birth and small samples. This research will produce a new estimate of the income effect, an important characteristic of the US population that has been overlooked in previous work. The few previous studies that have incorporated measures of non-labor income in earnings elasticity estimations have all done so in the context of tax reform. This research project is the first one to look directly at changes in non-labor income's impact on earnings arising from taxes, resulting in a more transparent identification strategy and greater statistical power.","Income Effects in Labor Supply: Evidence from Child-Related Tax Benefits","Wingender, Philippe, and Sara LaLumia. 2016. “Income Effects in Labor Supply: Evidence from Child-Related Tax Benefits.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 16-24.

"Dynamics of Workplace Wages, Returns to R&D and the Economic Impact of Science and Engineering Workers","The purpose of this research project is to improve understanding of the quality of Title 13, Chapter 5 data on employment and wages, and to prepare estimates of the dynamics of workplace wages and their relation to overall changes in the wage distribution, the economic return to Research and Development (R&D) (both private and social), and the role of science and engineering workers on innovation, knowledge transmission, and economic growth. The project compares employment and wages across the data files of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the economic census, and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employer Characteristics File. Cross comparison of employment and wages from the three separate sources will establish whether reporting variance can be duplicated across sources, methods for the allocation of firm based R&D expenditure to establishments, and investigate recall bias for employment measures in the economic census. Recall bias will be quantified for economic census respondents that report March 12 employment that has a closer match to fourth quarter LEHD employment or first quarter employment for the following year, in comparison to first quarter LEHD employment for the March 12 period of the economic census year. Fourth quarter or first quarter of the following year employment is closer to the timing of when economic census survey forms are mailed out. The extent of recall bias will be related to firm characteristics, for example as captured by worker turnover statistics in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators. The project will produce population estimates of establishment and individual wage distributions and wage dynamics. The project will also produce population estimates of the effect of R&D activity on firm productivity. As a complement to the firm based analyses, the research will investigate wage distributions over time, coming from the perspective of the worker and using the Current Population Survey. The data will allow the follow­ing of workers from firm to firm and measure the R&D content of their working experience. Finally, the project will provide population estimates of the impact of unions, innovation, firm volatil­ity, and financial distress on employment and wages.","Impacts of Unionization on Quality and Productivity: Regression Discontinuity Evidence From Nursing Homes","Sojourner, Aaron J., Robert J.

Recall bias will be quantified for economic census respondents that report March 12 employment that has a closer match to fourth quarter LEHD employment or first quarter employment for the following year, in comparison to first quarter LEHD employment for the March 12 period of the economic census year. Fourth quarter or first quarter of the following year employment is closer to the timing of when economic census survey forms are mailed out. The extent of recall bias will be related to firm characteristics, for example as captured by worker turnover statistics in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators. The project will produce population estimates of establishment and individual wage distributions and wage dynamics. The project will also produce population estimates of the effect of R&D activity on firm productivity. As a complement to the firm based analyses, the research will investigate wage distributions over time, coming from the perspective of the worker and using the Current Population Survey. The data will allow the follow­ing of workers from firm to firm and measure the R&D content of their working experience. Finally, the project will provide population estimates of the impact of unions, innovation, firm volatil­ity, and financial distress on employment and wages.","R&D Spillovers and Labor Mobility","Barth, Erling, James Davis, Richard Freeman, Gerald Marschke, and Andrew Wang (2017). “R&D Spillovers and Labor Mobility.” University of Albany, State University of New York mimeo.","2017","Boston",NA,"Barth, Erling, James Davis, Richard Freeman, Gerald Marschke, and Andrew Wang","2017",NA

"Immigration, Earnings and the Dynamics of Labor Market Adjustment in the United States: Comparing CPS Earnings to LEHD Earnings Records","This project will increase the understanding of how local labor markets adjust to an influx of immigrants.  With quarterly data on the earnings and geographic location of workers from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, the proposed research will model the process of labor market adjustment by following individual workers over time.  This unique data will allow us to both model the short term effects that are missed by other studies using Census data as well as document the longer-term effects on workers affected by immigration in specific industries.  The study will carefully analyze the impact of skill complementarities between native and immigrant workers by occupation, within detailed industries, and at the firm level. 
The research proposes to link the Current Population Survey March Supplement to the LEHD using the PIK-CPS crosswalk.  In addition to the LEHD Employer Characteristic File (ECF), this project needs the LEHD Employment History Files (EHF), the LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF), the LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), the LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL), and the LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) Impute files.

"New Rural Employers and their First Employees","We focus on new employers, their first employees, and the potential of micro-firms for rural development. Linking internal datasets ILBD, LEHD, and SBO, we will analyze the transition from nonemployer to employer status in rural communities and how nascent employers fare (revenue, longevity). Our models of new employer performance will include attributes of the rural communities. For those new employers who can be matched to SBO, we will analyze the personal characteristics of business owners and how they relate to firm performance. We will also study the first employees hired on by these new employers with special attention given to the wages, tenure, mobility of the newly employed.","College Graduates, Local Retailers, and Community Belonging in the United States","Stroope, Samuel, Aaron B.

"Public Subsidies and Higher Education","This project describes and estimates models of student geographic mobility. Its objective is to support ongoing research on college-going behavior among high school graduates. This work focuses on the college-going behavior of youth residing near college taxing districts. It exploits the abrupt change in tuition costs at college taxing district boundaries to estimate price elasticities of demand for higher education. For this proposal, we use household data from the restricted-version of the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey to test a key identifying assumption: college-age youth on opposite, yet adjacent, sides of community college taxing district boundaries are similar along observable dimensions. This work will enhance the utility Census Bureau data in two ways. First, it contributes to developing means of increasing the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing public programs and policies. Accordingly, the project will link census blocks for a large state with detailed information on college taxing district attributes such as tuition levels and property tax rates. Furthermore, the proposal contributes to preparing estimates of population and characteristics of populations by examining the extent to which college tuition subsidies affect geographic mobility and whether such subsidies are capitalized into housing values.","Do Public Tuition Subsidies Promote College Enrollment?

"Disability Insurance and Employment Decisions","Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the disabled and blind are both federal programs designed to insure people against loss of income due to health conditions, and participation in these programs is an important issue for millions of American households. Together, DI and SSI make up one of the four major insurance programs of the country (Krueger and Meyer, 2002). This study will examine the employment effects of DI and SSI and will explore channels of disability insurance application as well as factors influencing disability insurance applications. This research will use the Census Bureau’s primary survey of government transfer programs, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The researchers will link SIPP panels (core and selected modules) to the Master Beneficiary Records (MBR) of the SSA, to the so-called 831 files, and to earnings records. Usage of these SIPP surveys will be further enhanced by creating monthly and weekly person-level panels, and by assessing the quality of self-reported health status in the SIPP.","Effect of New Psychotropic Pharmaceuticals on Disability Insurance Applications: Evidence from Matched SIPP/Administrative Data","VanDerwerken, A.

"The Role of Agents and Brokers in the Market for Health Insurance - An Analysis of MEPS-IC","Despite the influence of agents and brokers on health insurance decision making, especially for small businesses, little is known about the relationship between the structure of the agent/broker market and access and affordability of insurance. Our research aims to fill this gap by investigating the role of agents and brokers in the health insurance decisions of small businesses, a sector that is particularly vulnerable to potential problems regarding health insurance financing. We will investigate whether the structure of the market for health insurance agents and brokers is associated with outcomes such as the likelihood of shopping for coverage, offering coverage, high deductible plans and health savings accounts. The data on the market for insurance agents and brokers will be based on the membership database of the National Association of Health Underwriters. We will merge this data with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component, a nationally representative sample of employers along with information on their health insurance offerings and characteristics of the policies offered, as well as other information at the employer level. All our analyses will control for relevant market-level demographic variables and state small group regulations.","The Role of Agents and Brokers in the Market for Health Insurance","Karaca-Mandic, Pinar, Roger Feldman, and Peter Graven, “The Role of Agents and Brokers in the Market for Health Insurance,” Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2018, 85:7-34.

"Does Organizational Innovation Complement Technology Adoption?","We propose a series of related analyses to understand the nature of technology-related organizational capital. Our first analysis attempts to gain further insight into the organizational innovations wrought by Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) systems on the economy. By combining Census data sets with our ERP data from Harte Hanks and SAP, we can study how ERP systems have affected organizational change at both the plant and the firm level. Among firms that adopted ERP systems, how did their operations change? Which plants were closed and how was production reallocated? A purpose of this analysis is to examine what internal changes differentiated the most successful implementers of this new technology from the ones that were less successful.
Our other analyses concern the relationship between IT and the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy. The first phenomenon we want to explore in this stream of research is that of persistent firm heterogeneity. Are there greater and more persistent differences in performance between the leading and lagging firms in IT-intensive industries? We are also interested in whether there is greater “Schumpeterian” creative destruction in the most IT-intensive industries. Do the most productive firms in one period generate a greater share of output in the next period? Does the answer change depending on the intensity of IT usage in the industry? Are there more firm births and deaths in these industries? We are also interested in further exploring the relationship between IT and firm size, and examine the distribution of employment in industries by size and IT usage.","Physician Practice Organization and Negotiated Prices: Evidence from State Law Changes","Hausman, Naomi, and Kurt Lavetti. 2021.

"Geographic Deregulation of U.S. Banking, Market Selection, and Economic Growth","This study investigates how changes in state banking laws affect firms' access to credit, asset accumulation, and economic performance. Work will focus on manufacturing firms but will also investigate how banking law changes affect other sectors of the economy. The research uses the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Census of Manufactures (CMF), and the Longitudinal Business Database to analyze the effects of banking deregulation on plant-level output, employment, investment, productivity, and capital-to-labor ratios. Further, the project investigates the influence of banking deregulation on the market selection process and the reallocation of resources across manufacturing plants. The study will also use the Survey of Business Owners and the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database to provide a direct research link between credit markets and the productive sector by identifying firms that use debt to finance startup capital. This will allow the researchers to investigate whether banking deregulation affects access to credit for new businesses or the future performance and asset accumulation of borrowing firms. The research will benefit the Census Bureau by studying the quality of the data in the recently launched QPC. The researchers will compare the data in the QPC to data in the ASM and CMF, in addition to using the QPC (and it predecessor, the annual Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) to study variation in capacity utilization rates across states. The analysis of capacity utilization variation will be performed in order to evaluate whether the QPC can be used to make inferences at the state level.  Finally, this work will benefit the Bureau by producing population estimates of how changes in state banking regulations affect firms' access to credit and asset accumulation, and how such changes influence the manufacturing sector in terms of the economic performance and input choices of plants, the reallocation of resources, and the market selection process.","Access to Credit, Market Selection, and Economic Growth","Melendez-Lugo, Joel. 2012. “Access to Credit, Market Selection, and Economic Growth.” Ph.D. dissertation, University of Houston.

"Firm Level Adjustment of U.S. Food Firms to Globalization","This project analyzes food manufacturing firms’ adjustment to globalization by investigating the linkages among productivity, exports and imports, and the role of mergers and acquisitions on firms’ decisions to conduct arm’s length transactions as opposed to intra-firm trade. This project will shed light on the impact of trade in the following areas of the food manufacturing industry: (1) changes in product mix and product proliferation as well as changes in employment due to import competition and trade reforms; (2) the relationship between mergers and acquisitions and firms’ decisions to engage in arm’s length vs. intra-firm trade; (3) productivity differences between firms engaged in trade relative to those that are not; (4) innovation and product differentiation as engines for growth which promote competitiveness (measured as returns to factors of production). For the productivity estimation, this project applies a methodology to adjust the measurement of productivity by taking into consideration both simultaneity and omitted price variable biases. The industries where firms have differentiated products, as in the food manufacturing industry, have biased coefficient estimates using the general approach.","Productivity Growth and Efficiency Analysis in US Food Manufacturing Industry: Exporters and Firm-level Characteristics","Geylani, Pinar Celikkol. 2020.

"Exploring How Neighborhood Quality Influences Household Residential Choices","Understanding which factors attract households to particular neighborhoods provides a critical lens into neighborhood change. Previous research has found that the neighborhood choices of in-moving households are important drivers of neighborhood change. We still know very little about what neighborhood factors drive these location decisions. This research project explores whether the quality of the zoned public school, the crime rate, and/or the racial composition of a neighborhood differentially attract particular types of households to that neighborhood. Four key dimensions of households – their tenure, income, race, and presence of children – provide the focus for this research.  Using the internal versions of the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, and the American Housing Survey, along with rich external datasets describing neighborhood characteristics, this project will overcome existing data limitations that have prevented researchers from gaining insight into how neighborhood quality influences household residential choices. These detailed microdata will be employed to estimate separately which neighborhood factors attract households to particular neighborhoods and then model household neighborhood choice, incorporating information on previous residence to improve the specification.  Part of this project will conduct an in-depth exploration of item response rates in each of the different surveys used in order to gain a sense of the quality of the data on previous residence. It will take advantage of the changes in the ways in which the question is asked to see how changing the phrasing of the previous residence variable influences item response rates. We will also examine how differences in survey administration influence item response rates.","Has Falling Crime Invited Gentrification?","Ellen, Ingrid Gould, Keren Mertens Horn, and Davin Reed. 2017. “Has Falling Crime Invited Gentrification?” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 17-27.

"The Power of the Pill in Shaping U.S. Fertility and Childbearing Behavior","Despite celebrating the 50th anniversary of the FDA approval of the oral contraceptive pill, significant scholarly debate remains about the role that the Pill played in the dramatic demographic shifts of the 1960s. Estimating the causal impact of the Pill has been difficult because of the coincidence of its release with the peak of the baby boom, the rise of the women's movement, and many other social changes that render standard inter-temporal comparisons invalid. Bailey (2010) developed a quasi-experimental empirical strategy to address these problems. Specifically, she uses state-level variation in anti-obscenity ""Comstock laws"" which made the Pill illegal in 24 states, in conjunction with the timing of the introduction of the Pill in 1957 and the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Connecticut's Comstock statute in 1965 with Griswold v. Connecticut. This project proposes to use data from both the publicly available IPUMS and the restricted-access microdata from the decennial censuses to pursue three specific scientific aims:  (1) To use individual county-identifiers to develop and test a distance-based regression discontinuity methodology for estimating the impact of the birth control pill on completed fertility; (2) To use individual county-identifiers and the methodology in (1) to quantify the impact of the birth control pill on completed fertility, marital outcomes, child quality, and female labor force participation; and (3) To use this methodology to examine the impact of the birth control pill on disparities in these outcomes by race and education level.","Does Family Planning Increase Children's Opportunities?

This will include imports, exports, as well as internal flows within the United States – such as shipment of drywall from China to Miami, or a shipment of medical equipment by a firm in Minneapolis to Boston or Toronto. This study will estimate an economic model of trade flows that will explicitly incorporate the possibility that goods may move through the wholesale sector. This project will produce industry-level parameters related to transportation cost and the use of wholesaling. It will then use these estimates to evaluate the impact of increased international trade on the regional distribution of manufactures.","Imports, Heavy Goods, and Competition Away from the Coast","Singer, Ethan. 2016. “Imports, Heavy Goods, and Competition Away from the Coast.” University of Minnesota mimeo.

"Measuring the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy","This research will track large firms over time in both the Census Bureau trade transaction data and its Business Register. By tracking firms with large volumes of imports and exports, we will test the methodology used to create the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). There appear to be a number of firms that either do not export one year and then exhibit large export transaction values the following year, or export large amounts followed immediately by zero exports. Focusing on the source of these large changes would help identify potential bad matches, high firm level export volatility or important mergers & acquisitions in the Business Register. This project will also examine whether imports displace domestic production and exports. This would require linking detailed information from the Census of Manufactures product trailer data, detailed information on products used from the material trailer data, other product information from the Current Industrial Reports, and product information from the LFTTD to examine the product composition of U.S. firms’ domestic production, imports, and exports. A number of firms import products they do not report using and report exporting products they do not report producing.

Focusing on the source of these large changes would help identify potential bad matches, high firm level export volatility or important mergers & acquisitions in the Business Register. This project will also examine whether imports displace domestic production and exports. This would require linking detailed information from the Census of Manufactures product trailer data, detailed information on products used from the material trailer data, other product information from the Current Industrial Reports, and product information from the LFTTD to examine the product composition of U.S. firms’ domestic production, imports, and exports. A number of firms import products they do not report using and report exporting products they do not report producing.

"Using Census Data for Understanding Private Sector Employer Provision of Health Insurance","Employers and employees face economic incentives that encourage health insurance provision through the workplace. This project will use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) augmented with other federal and non-federal data sources to analyze employer behavior regarding the provision of health insurance. Specifically, we will estimate the net advantage or disadvantage to private sector employers of keeping or dropping health insurance under any changing economic incentives created by reforms to health care. The “net advantage” of dropping health insurance reflects an establishment's assessment of the potential value of exchange-based premium assistance credits (subsidies) that its workers could get if the employer dropped coverage; the value of the tax subsidy associated with offering health insurance; and the cost of the employer-shared responsibility requirement that an employer would incur if it dropped coverage. In addition, we will quantify the relationship between an employer's propensity to offer insurance and the tax price of insurance among workers in the establishment, characteristics of the establishment and its workforce, labor market conditions, and competition in the market for health insurance by modeling an employer's decision to offer health insurance. Finally, we will predict how economic incentives facing employers will alter their incentives to provide health insurance. 
The MEPS-IC are critical for analyzing the proposed issues as no other nationally representative data set exists that contains detailed information on health benefit offerings, premiums, and workforce composition of U.S. establishments. The resulting analyses will inform the Census Bureau about the relation between health insurance provision by employers and the economic incentives that businesses face, which are driven in large part by the characteristics of their workers and their families. We will develop methods to enhance the information contained in the MEPS-IC with respect to measuring an establishment's workforce composition, including estimating the wage distribution of full-time workers within establishments who are most likely to be eligible for health insurance. We will also develop methods to facilitate a comparison of the distribution of wage income reported for workers relative to the distribution of household income by workers in establishments. These analyses can facilitate a more complete assessment of employers' changing incentives to offer health insurance and they can test the sensitivity of how particular assumptions about employer behavior affect the offering decision. The proposed research also will benefit the Census Bureau by providing population estimates of establishment offers of health insurance under existing economic incentives and offers a flexible model for understanding how employer behavior may change in light of new economic incentives (e.g., differences by state or under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010).","How Will the Affordable Care Act Change Employers' Incentives to Offer Insurance?","Abraham, Jean M., Roger Feldman, and Peter Graven. 2014. “How Will the Affordable Care Act Change Employers’ Incentives to Offer Insurance?” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 14-02.

"Business Cycles, Business Dynamics and Firm Behavior","The goal of this project is to provide insights into the microeconomic underpinnings and effects of business cycles. A key goal is to extend the existing literature by examining the effects of the recent ""great recession"" and the consequent (ongoing) recovery. Another goal is to examine these issues for firms operating in the retail and service sectors. Most of the literature to date has focused on manufacturing industries, which represent a decreasing portion of GDP in the U.S. and other developed economies. The project will consist of three main parts. First, we will study the effects of business cycles on entry and exit of employer establishments, as well as transitions between non-employer and employer status, controlling for the effect of other important variables such as area demographics, establishment as well as industry characteristics, market size, and regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to entry. Second, we will study the impact of the business cycle and local financial conditions on investment behavior as well as business growth. Finally, we will study how firm pricing decisions vary over the business cycle. Our primary sources of data will be the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) and the Current Industrial Reports (CIR) maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, which we will complement with other public use data to which we have access.","How do Firms Grow in the U.S.?

"Business Cycles, Business Dynamics and Firm Behavior","The goal of this project is to provide insights into the microeconomic underpinnings and effects of business cycles. A key goal is to extend the existing literature by examining the effects of the recent ""great recession"" and the consequent (ongoing) recovery. Another goal is to examine these issues for firms operating in the retail and service sectors. Most of the literature to date has focused on manufacturing industries, which represent a decreasing portion of GDP in the U.S. and other developed economies. The project will consist of three main parts. First, we will study the effects of business cycles on entry and exit of employer establishments, as well as transitions between non-employer and employer status, controlling for the effect of other important variables such as area demographics, establishment as well as industry characteristics, market size, and regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to entry. Second, we will study the impact of the business cycle and local financial conditions on investment behavior as well as business growth.

"Firm financial constraints and employment","This research examines how financial constraints affect firm behavior and how a financially constrained firm's employees conditionally influence the impact of those constraints. Types of constraints studied here include restricted access to commercial bank credit, venture capital financing, and public bond and equity markets. This research tests whether employees alleviate financial constraints by deferring wages until firms can pay them. It also examines the alternative hypothesis that workers exacerbate financial constraints by requiring higher upfront wages as compensation for the higher risk of failure that a financially constrained firm faces, leading such a firm to invest less in the development and training of its employees.","Destructive Creation at Work: How Financial Distress Spurs Entrepreneurship","Babina, Tetyana. 2016. “Destructive Creation at Work: How Financial Distress Spurs Entrepreneurship.” Ph.D. dissertation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.","2016","Fed Board",NA,"Babina, Tetyana.","2016",NA

"Housing Recovery in New Orleans: A Multi-Level Approach to Vulnerability and Resilience (AHS Small Grants Project)","Hurricane Katrina wrought major damage to housing across the New Orleans area.  Five years later, recovery remained spotty.  Over 100,000 residents had not returned to the city and in some neighborhoods physical reconstruction remained incomplete despite significant resources having been dedicated to recovery.  The 2009 American Housing Survey’s special post-Katrina sample for metropolitan New Orleans allows researchers to understand better the critical factors in recovery for housing and households.  This project uses American Housing Survey (AHS) data to address questions of vulnerability to and resilience after a major natural disaster event.  The 2009 AHS special examination of post-Katrina New Orleans provides a significant opportunity to analyze vulnerability and recovery, providing new information to policy makers about how better to prepare for and respond to such events.  This study analyzes pre-Hurricane Katrina conditions, disaster damage, and post-Katrina recovery.  It focuses on repair and re-occupancy of housing units by their original inhabitants to address the multiple dimensions of vulnerability, considering how household, housing unit, and neighborhood characteristics affect recovery.  The analysis employs multi-level modeling to distinguish effects of different facets of vulnerability, and estimates the contribution of neighborhood status to housing recovery over and above household factors.","Housing Recovery in New Orleans: Assessing Vulnerability and Resilience using the American Housing Survey","Bates, Lisa K. 2012. “Housing Recovery in New Orleans: Assessing Vulnerability and Resilience using the American Housing Survey.” Portland State University mimeo. [RDC]","2012","Chicago",NA,"Bates, Lisa K.","2012",NA

"Patterns of Residential Settlement, Distribution,  and Locational Attainment in the United States:  1970-2000 and Beyond","This study will use confidential Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data to examine trends in residential settlement patterns in the United States since 1970.  Specifically, the research will compare the relative importance of socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity as predictors of observed settlement patterns for households that move into southern metropolitan areas during recent decades.  In the process of making these comparisons, the researchers will examine differential trends in locational attainment between races for inter-urban migrants, intra-urban migrants, and non-migrants in southern U.S. metropolitan areas.  Results will provide a test of how well certain models predict the observed settlement and distribution patterns of movers during the time period under study, and in the process will establish the basis for better understanding the predictive role of migration when studying the locational attainment of African Americans.
Locational attainment refers to neighborhood quality as measured by variables such as poverty, crime rates, housing values, pollution levels, unemployment, and school quality.  This study will determine if locational attainment differences exist between particular groups of inter-urban migrants, and if so, what factors underlie such differences.  Similar analyses will compare locational attainment for inter-urban migrants with that of  intra-urban and non-migrants, based on questions in the aforementioned Decennial Censuses and the ACS about having moved in the past year (ACS) or five years (Decennial).  The assimilation model predicts that SES is the only important predictor of the settlement and distribution patterns of movers.  Alternatively, other models posit that racial and ethnic distributions underlie these patterns.  This study will determine which model best describes the patterns observed in the microdata from 1970 to 2008 and beyond.  This time period is of particular importance to the researchers, whose interest lies in studying the trend in migration of African-Americans out of the South and into non-southern metropolitan areas in the decades preceding 1970, coupled with the more recent decadal trends reversing this process as Blacks return to the South and disproportionately settle in growing Southern metropolitan areas.  The researchers will combine data from questions on recent movement and location of birth to determine which individuals meet the specific migration criteria of interest.","The New El Dorado: Black Locational Attainment in the Post-Civil Rights Era","Anderson, Donovan A. 2015. “The New El Dorado: Black Locational Attainment in the Post-Civil Rights Era.” Ph.D. dissertation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

"Firm Networks and Firm Expansion","This research seeks to characterize the U.S. buyer-supplier network. Arguably one of the most vital economic systems in existence, surprisingly no one to date has theoretically or empirically modeled its structure. The researchers will begin by establishing basic (yet previously undocumented) facts about the U.S. input-output structure. They will then develop a dynamic model of firm birth, death, expansion, contraction, and trade that captures the economic fundamentals driving the evolution of the economy's buyer-supplier network structure. Solving the model to generate predicted vertical production patterns, they will take these to the data to estimate the model's parameters. This will permit any one of a number of conceptual exercises to investigate how various policies or changes in economic fundamentals would impact the equilibrium buyer-supplier network structure. The analyses will revolve around the following questions: When are two establishments likely to be linked to one another? How are shocks transmitted across linked establishments/firms? How are shocks transmitted within firms and how is production organized within firms, across their establishments?

This will permit any one of a number of conceptual exercises to investigate how various policies or changes in economic fundamentals would impact the equilibrium buyer-supplier network structure.

"Improving the Connection between the Spatial and the Survey Sciences","The Spatial Sciences Census Research Node (SSCRN) will foster a connection between the spatial and the survey sciences. This bridge will yield both immediate and long‐term benefits for the estimation, dissemination, and usability of the small area statistics produced by the Census Bureau. Small area statistics describe the character of the population within small geographic zones, such as census tracts, and can be imprecise. Apart from the impractical solution of increasing the sample size, the only way to reduce the uncertainty of survey estimates is to utilize ancillary information about the population. Historically, very little attention has been paid to the geographic distribution of populations within these small areas. This research will increase knowledge about the organization of the population within small geographic areas, and exploit new forms of geographic information and recent advances in spatial statistics, to make small area estimates more accurate. This project will develop software tools that will enhance the usability of small area estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) by allowing users to intelligently combine tracts to reduce uncertainty in variables of interest. In addition to improving small area population estimates, an improved understanding of the geographic micro‐structure of the U.S. population is of broad scientific interest and may expand knowledge about socio‐spatial processes like segregation and neighborhood effects.","Who Are the People in My Neighborhood?

"Improving the Interpretability and Usability of the American Community Survey Through Hierarchical Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Statistical Models - NCRN","This project will use confidential microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide an efficient framework for carrying out small area estimation (SAE), while preserving geographical and temporal constraints that arise from the survey’s aggregate structure. Further, by borrowing strength across multiple scales in space and time, and multiple outcomes, the proposed approach will reduce the variance in the ACS small area estimates and its derivatives. Additionally, from a data users perspective, methodology will be developed that will simultaneously provide coherent estimates on several temporal scales, rather than being hampered by the published multiyear estimates. Importantly, this will allow researchers to compare trends across different geographies. 
The proposed methods are of independent interest and can be used in many of the other surveys administered by US Census Bureau (and other Federal Statistics Agencies). For example, straightforward modification of the proposed methods can be used in conjunction with the Current Population Survey, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Agricultural Resource Management Survey, among others. Furthermore, several of the proposed methods (SAE) will directly carry over to the area of disease mapping and thus, provide important tools for public health. In short, the proposed methods provide novel solutions across a wide-range of applied problems, contributing to the statistics literature, Federal, State and Local governments and many subject matter disciplines.","Bayesian Unit Level Modeling of Non-Gaussian Survey Data Under Informative Sampling with Application to Small Area Estimation","Parker, Paul A. 2021.

The proposed methods are of independent interest and can be used in many of the other surveys administered by US Census Bureau (and other Federal Statistics Agencies). For example, straightforward modification of the proposed methods can be used in conjunction with the Current Population Survey, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Agricultural Resource Management Survey, among others. Furthermore, several of the proposed methods (SAE) will directly carry over to the area of disease mapping and thus, provide important tools for public health. In short, the proposed methods provide novel solutions across a wide-range of applied problems, contributing to the statistics literature, Federal, State and Local governments and many subject matter disciplines.","Computationally Efficient Bayesian Unit-Level Models for Non-Gaussian Data Under Informative Sampling with Application to Estimation of Health Insurance Coverage","Paul A.

"Home Equity  Lending and Small Business: Relaxing Credit Constraints in Texas","This project uses integrated data to measure the characteristics and dynamics of small and non-employer businesses, and evaluates how well Census Bureau data products measure small business dynamics and the characteristics of small business owners. Home equity is an important source of capital for many small business ventures, but it is possible that the business activities of these marginal entrepreneurs are not well represented, or well measured in Census Bureau data. This research evaluates how measurement of small- and non-employer business characteristics and dynamics change with access to home equity. A change in Texas law provides a natural experiment to directly evaluate how well administrative and survey sources measure the characteristics and activity of business that rely on this form of financing. Economic growth may depend on the ability to convert personal property into liquid capital, but testing such a theory is difficult since it is hard to disentangle the effects of the ability to borrow from other institutional and economic variables. The Texas law change provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of changing one feature of the bundle of property rights that attach to home ownership. Specifically, the research design uses the variation in access to home equity financing induced by the law change to identify its influence on the formation and growth of small and young businesses.","A Comparison of Firm Age in the Survey of Business Owners and the Longitudinal Business Database","Lastrapes, William, Ian Schmutte, Thor Watson. 2020. “A Comparison of Firm Age in the Survey of Business Owners and the Longitudinal Business Database.” CES Technical Notes Series 20-08, Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau.","2020","Atlanta",NA,"Lastrapes, William, Ian Schmutte, Thor Watson.","2020",NA

"Labor Market Implications of External Shocks","The ways in which external economic forces influence firm-level input and output decisions have important implications for economic welfare and social well-being. Firms and plant-owners often make decisions to maximize profits or shareholder value, and they may not fully internalize the effects of their production decisions on the local economy in which they are located. Similarly, firm owners or managers do not necessarily internalize the potential long run costs to workers when making plant layoff decisions. In some cases, these externalities create market failures. Addressing these externalities requires a proper understanding both of how external economic forces influence firm and worker decisions as well as how these decisions influence long run costs and economic incidence. This project will characterize how external market and non-market forces influence firm and worker behavior, while also evaluating the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation of the labor market more generally. The researchers will evaluate the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation in the labor market using the longitudinal earnings and employment records from the LEHD infrastructure file. This research will produce estimates quantifying how changes in demand drive employment responses and worker outcomes in the automobile industry and how demand shocks in a particular industry may propagate to nearby industries. The researchers will also evaluate how environmental regulation influences the type of worker hired at newly regulated firms. In addition, this research will evaluate how environmental regulation influences technology choice within a firm, and how these technology choices influence the skill mix and wage structure within that particular firm.","Why is Pollution from U.S. Manufacturing Declining?

"International Buyer-Seller Matches","This project attempts to increase the usefulness of the Census Bureau's international trade statistics by assessing the quality and possible biases of the shipment-level data that lie behind them. A second goal is to develop descriptive statistics and structural models that characterize the formation and maturation of cross-border business relationships, again using shipment-level data. Both dimensions of the analysis will improve an understanding of trade flow dynamics between the United States and its trading partners. The first part of this project will document international discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics at the level of individual shipments, looking in particular for evidence that might indicate a reporting/collection problem on the U.S. side. The second part of the project will augment the trade shipments records with information on the characteristics of the exporting firms and importing firms, which will allow study of the characteristics of buyer-seller matches. One exercise will involve the estimation of a dynamic model of international trade in which firms' exporting (importing) behavior reflects a search and learning process in their foreign markets. A second exercise will develop descriptive statistics that allow characterization of the evolution of international buyer-seller networks, and will contrast the characteristics of rapidly expanding networks (China-U.S.) with slower-growing networks (Colombia-U.S.).

"Generating A Geographic Wage Comparison Index","This research will create a new implementation of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) comparable wage index (CWI), based on confidential data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS). The CWI is an annual measure of uncontrollable variation in wages across geographical regions, and has been published by NCES for the years 1997 through 2005. The base year CWI was originally created using 2000 Decennial Census long form Integrated Public Use Microdata Series data (IPUMS), and the CWI for the other years were created using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Occupational Expenditure Survey (OES). This project aims to produce a new CWI using restricted-access ACS data for the years 2005 forward, and to compare index estimates produced from these files to estimates computed using public use ACS microdata. In the process, the CWI methodology will be modified based on recommendations of a Technical Expert Panel convened on behalf of NCES. The project will benefit the ACS data by producing population estimates (the wage index) that allow a direct comparison with estimates produced using publicly available data.","Public-Use vs. Restricted-Use: An Analysis Using the American Community Survey","Kinney, Satkartar K., and Alan F.

The project will match a database of Indian firms provided by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)-Prowess with the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). The LFTTD can credibly establish a causal relationship between U.S. importer types and their characteristics, on the one hand, and the productivity of Indian firms, as well as identify the mechanisms that can explain these relationships. This research will produce estimates of the nature of adjustment of U.S. imports during large crises, and if import adjustments happen at the extensive margin, with U.S. importers dropping overseas suppliers, or at the intensive margin, with importers adjusting downward the quantity purchased from each supplier.","Firm-to-Firm Matching Along the Global Supply Chain","Dragusanu, Raluca. 2014. “Firm-to-Firm Matching Along the Global Supply Chain.” Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University.

"Firm Dynamics Across Sectors and Countries","In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis of 2008, employment growth in the U.S. economy was unusually sluggish compared to other postwar recessions of similar magnitude. In standard models in economics, the speed of firms' adjustment to shocks is presumed to have significant influence on the aggregate rate of employment growth. However, there has been surprisingly little empirical work investigating the determinants of flexibility firms have in responding to shocks. In the wake of the recent recession there have been controversial debates about the power of announcements to stimulate current investment activity and employment: Under which conditions will firms react swiftly to news about the economy? Along which margins are establishments adjusting: do they change prices, employment, investment, or product variety and technology, or do they simply enter or exit altogether? And how important for a speedy adjustment are determinants which are internal to the firm, such as technology or forecasting ability, as opposed to market distortions which are external to firms? This project will produce estimates that characterize dynamic business responses to forecastable shocks and will evaluate whether measures of dynamic adjustment responses forecast exit patterns especially of small employer and non-employer businesses. Based on these new estimates, the researchers will make recommendations about extending the set of variables to include establishment-level adjustment speed to forecasted shocks, which might help to predict current size and the likelihood of transition from a single-establishment to a multi-establishment firm.","Does Firm Ownership Matter For the Business Cycle?","Berger, David; Sunderam, Adi (2019) ""Does Firm Ownership Matter For the Business Cycle?” Mimeo","2019","Dallas",NA,"Berger, David; Sunderam, Adi","2019",NA

"Estimating the Effects of Bankruptcy Regimes on Firm Outcomes","This study will identify the differing economic impacts, measured in a variety of ways, between two forms of bankruptcy: the reorganization process of chapter 11 and the liquidation process of chapter 7. Using Census microdata combined with external data, the establishment-level operations of these firms can be observed following the bankruptcy resolution, and the different impacts will be quantified. Typically, research treats the cost of bankruptcy in terms of reduction in the market value of the bankrupt firm. However, when a firm is completely liquidated, it does not end with zero total economic value since its assets (and human capital) are sold to other productive firms and thereby redeployed. This research will quantify the costs of bankruptcy in terms of employment, payroll, and productivity losses, rather than just the dollar value lost to the bankrupt firm and its creditors. This will more accurately depict from where the losses caused by financial distress come, and how large they truly are. Furthermore, relatively little consideration has been given to the question of whether financial distress imposes externalities on other companies. Suppliers, customers, and competitors may be affected when a firm is liquidated or reorganized. This project will examine the behavior of other firms operating in the local economies of bankrupt firms in different bankruptcy regime, in order to quantify the bankruptcy regime differential impact. Although it is very difficult to overcome the selection into the two bankruptcy regimes, the researchers will use heterogeneity across bankruptcy judges as an instrumental variable to estimate the unbiased effect that compares the effects these bankruptcy regimes have on financially distressed firms.","Asset Allocation in Bankruptcy","Bernstein, Shai, Emanuele Colonnelli, and Benjamin Iverson. 2016. “Asset Allocation in Bankruptcy.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 16-13.","2016","Stanford",NA,"Bernstein, Shai, Emanuele Colonnelli, and Benjamin Iverson.","2016",NA

Typically, research treats the cost of bankruptcy in terms of reduction in the market value of the bankrupt firm. However, when a firm is completely liquidated, it does not end with zero total economic value since its assets (and human capital) are sold to other productive firms and thereby redeployed. This research will quantify the costs of bankruptcy in terms of employment, payroll, and productivity losses, rather than just the dollar value lost to the bankrupt firm and its creditors. This will more accurately depict from where the losses caused by financial distress come, and how large they truly are. Furthermore, relatively little consideration has been given to the question of whether financial distress imposes externalities on other companies. Suppliers, customers, and competitors may be affected when a firm is liquidated or reorganized. This project will examine the behavior of other firms operating in the local economies of bankrupt firms in different bankruptcy regime, in order to quantify the bankruptcy regime differential impact. Although it is very difficult to overcome the selection into the two bankruptcy regimes, the researchers will use heterogeneity across bankruptcy judges as an instrumental variable to estimate the unbiased effect that compares the effects these bankruptcy regimes have on financially distressed firms.","Bankruptcy Spillovers","Bernstein, Shai, Emanuele Colonnelli, Xavier Giroud, and Benjamin Iverson. 2017. “Bankruptcy Spillovers.” NBER Working Paper No. 23162.","2017","Stanford",NA,"Bernstein, Shai, Emanuele Colonnelli, Xavier Giroud, and Benjamin Iverson.","2017",NA

"The 'Safe Design Project': Addressing Disclosure Risk of Contextualized Microdata in Survey Design","Demand for contextualized microdata has increased dramatically over the last decade and is expected to increase even more in years to come. The Census Bureau collects data to produce timely population estimates on demographic, social, housing, and economic characteristics for a broad spectrum of geographic areas in the United States and is therefore in a unique position to meet some of this demand. However, releasing geographic details in public-use microdata may increase the risk of disclosure. Current disclosure limitation practices involve suppressing geographic details for spatial units that fail to meet a predefined population threshold (e.g., 100,000). Users interested in studying persons nested within less-populated geographies (e.g., rural counties, tracts, block groups) must access restricted-use data through data enclaves. Neither of these approaches fully satisfies the growing demand for geographically-rich microdata that is being fueled by a variety of researchers, analysts, decision-makers, and administrators. To help alleviate barriers to use, this project will develop methodology that supports the efficient identification of sampling and database designs and associated masking techniques that allow more geographic detail to be released on microdata products, without increased disclosure risk or unnecessary survey costs. This research will use the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) data as the empirical foundation, with the aim of producing statistics that summarize findings from the evaluation of the methodology and broad guidelines derived from disclosure simulations, all of which are to be carefully constructed so as to ensure the confidentiality of the underlying data and disclosure practices.","Finding a Needle in a Haystack: The Theoretical and Empirical Foundations of Assessing Disclosure Risk for Contextualized Microdata","Leicht, Kevin T. and Kristine Witkowski. “Finding a Needle in a Haystack: The Theoretical and Empirical Foundations of Assessing Disclosure Risk for Contextualized Microdata”.

"The Microfoundations of Trade in Industrial Products","Complex trade relationships and sourcing strategies in industrial manufacturing complicates the classification and measurement of domestic industrial activity. Imprecise measurement of outsourcing-related activities can lead to imprecise measures of industry contributions to economic growth and productivity in manufacturing. This research will improve the quality and understanding of microdata on domestic imports of industrial commodities. The Census Bureau maintains a rich dataset of the universe of transaction-level import data linked to firm-level data. These data, along with establishment-level data collected from the industrial sector, are used to characterize the structure of imports in the industrial commodities sector. The descriptive statistics and regression estimates generated will document structural changes in import flows over time and across industries. This research will also identify determinants of domestic firms' sourcing decisions. These statistics will provide a richer portrait of trade patterns in these important sectors.","Challenges in the Measurement of Leakage Risk","Fowlie, Meredith, and Mar Reguant, “Challenges in the Measurement of Leakage Risk,” American Economic Review, 2018, 108:124-129.","2018","Berkeley",NA,"Fowlie, Meredith, and Mar Reguant, “Challenges in the Measurement of Leakage Risk,” American Economic Review,","2018",NA

"Introduction of Head Start, Maternal Labor Supply and Child Outcomes","This research will estimate the effect of Head Start on maternal labor supply and the effect of Head Start on child school progression. This study will use data from decennial censuses to estimate changes in aggregate maternal labor force participation rates and hours worked per week in response to the enrollment of 3-5 year old children in the Head Start program. First, the researchers will examine the non-response rates on maternal labor force participation and hours worked for low-income mothers by mothers’ characteristics such as education, race, and marital status, and document how this has changed from 1970 to 2000, to evaluate the comparability between different waves of the survey data. This will permit evaluation of whether current weights sufficiently adjust for the non-response patterns for low-income families and potentially identify the sources and the magnitude of this measurement problem. Second, this research will provide aggregate measures for the employment of low-income mothers with young children (e.g., aged 3-8) by education and race, thereby providing measures of the social conditions or well-being of children in low-income families.","Introduction of Head Start and Maternal Labor Supply: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design","Long, Cuiping. 2016. “Introduction of Head Start and Maternal Labor Supply: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 16-35.

"The Determinants and Ramifications of Firms' Global Production","The world economy is becoming more integrated as different stages of a single production process are performed in multiple countries. Measuring this type of production fragmentation is essential to ensure accurate statistics about current U.S. economic activity and its future growth prospects. This project will combine multiple data sources to provide new measures of production fragmentation, with a particular emphasis on activities that U.S. firms choose to locate in foreign countries. These new measures will address: (1) how fragmentation differs across U.S. firms and geography; (2) the determinants of firms' decisions to fragment production; and (3) the domestic employment and R&D ramifications of firms' fragmentation decisions. To develop new data that measure firms’ global production choices, this project will use items collected in the 2007 Economic Census to identify individual establishments that report fragmenting and offshoring production. To assess firms’ globalization decisions over time, the research will improve the existing linkages currently in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transaction Database by developing new methodologies to link the trade transactions data to the Longitudinal Business Database, as well as by linking the trade data directly to the economic censuses, the Company Organization Survey, and to the SDC Thomson merger and acquisition data. The new datasets developed under this project will expand the scope and range of the economic activity that can be studied at the plant and firm levels, leading to improved measures of the import, export, and offshoring activity in the U.S. economy.","Breaking Up Is Hard To Do: Why Firms Fragment Production Across Locations","Fort, Teresa C. 2013. “Breaking Up Is Hard To Do: Why Firms Fragment Production Across Locations.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 13-35.

To develop new data that measure firms’ global production choices, this project will use items collected in the 2007 Economic Census to identify individual establishments that report fragmenting and offshoring production. To assess firms’ globalization decisions over time, the research will improve the existing linkages currently in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transaction Database by developing new methodologies to link the trade transactions data to the Longitudinal Business Database, as well as by linking the trade data directly to the economic censuses, the Company Organization Survey, and to the SDC Thomson merger and acquisition data. The new datasets developed under this project will expand the scope and range of the economic activity that can be studied at the plant and firm levels, leading to improved measures of the import, export, and offshoring activity in the U.S. economy.","Factoryless Goods Producers in the U.S","Bernard, Andrew B., and Teresa C.

"Globalization, Investment and Corporate Payout Strategies","Firms in recent years have changed their corporate payout strategies and have gone more global in their activities. This project investigates the relationship between the international activities of a firm, its profitability, payout strategies, and capital accumulation. The analysis is carried out on three categories of firms according to their payout strategy: (1) dividend payers and regular repurchasers, (2) regular repurchasers, and (3) occasional repurchasers. It starts with an assessment of the relationship between global activities and the observed corporate payout behavior, focusing on the international characteristics of firms, controlling for other firm, product, and country characteristics. Then, it assesses the relationship between global activities and corporate profitability for these three groups of firms. The last part investigates whether the increase in payments coincides with the decrease in capital accumulation and employment.","Constructing a Bridge File: Compustat to the SSEL","Deniz Civril, 2020.

"Modeling the Social Environmental Influences and Mechanisms of Suicide","This project estimates individual-level suicide risk within the general population for sixteen states during the years 2005-2011 using person-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), which compiles follow-back information on nearly all suicides occurring in roughly one third of U.S. states. Appropriate combination of these datasets generates a cross-sectional sample that provides adequate power for statistical hypothesis tests and permits joint examination of individual- and community-level risk factors. This project aims to refit models on a dataset constructed using restricted-access ACS records containing county of residence. This increased geographic specificity may enhance previous findings, which include several individual-community interaction effects.","Examining Multi-Level Correlates of Suicide by Merging NVDRS and ACS Data","Boulifard, David A., and Bernice A.

"Short-Run and Long-Run Impacts of Pollution Abatement Spending on Economic and Environmental Outcomes","The research investigates the impact of pollution abatement spending on a variety of economic and environmental outcomes at manufacturing plants, including production costs and productivity, employment, investment, location, and emissions of various pollutants. Timing of the transition process is of particular interest as new regulations take effect, potentially influencing investment in pollution abatement capital equipment, changes in production processes, and shifts in activity across plants. This research considers both the initial expansion of federal regulation in the 1970s and later regulations, such as EPA’s multimedia cluster rule affecting the pulp and paper industry and California’s recent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The analyses take advantage of the plant- and firm-level detail in the Census Bureau data in testing whether different types of plants and firms show different responses to pollution abatement costs.","The Impacts of Lower Natural Gas Prices on Jobs in the US Manufacturing Sector","Gray, Wayne & Joshua Linn & Richard Morgenstern. 2019. “The Impacts of Lower Natural Gas Prices on Jobs in the US Manufacturing Sector”, The Energy Journal, September 2019, 40(5) 169-193.","2019","Boston",NA,"Gray, Wayne & Joshua Linn & Richard Morgenstern.","2019",NA

"Short-Run and Long-Run Impacts of Pollution Abatement Spending on Economic and Environmental Outcomes","The research investigates the impact of pollution abatement spending on a variety of economic and environmental outcomes at manufacturing plants, including production costs and productivity, employment, investment, location, and emissions of various pollutants. Timing of the transition process is of particular interest as new regulations take effect, potentially influencing investment in pollution abatement capital equipment, changes in production processes, and shifts in activity across plants. This research considers both the initial expansion of federal regulation in the 1970s and later regulations, such as EPA’s multimedia cluster rule affecting the pulp and paper industry and California’s recent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

"Social Indicators for Rural Alaska Communities (SIRAC)","As arctic residents confront accelerating global forces of change, researchers and decision makers face a huge loss of information on adaptation and social outcomes. For instance, have social and economic conditions for Alaska Natives living in a given community changed since 2000? Do current conditions differ from one community or small region to another? During the past several decades, such questions could be answered by using the published Census Bureau statistics derived from the decennial Census long form survey. Unfortunately, the first American Community Survey (ACS) results published in late 2010 for rural Alaska communities exhibit a large downgrade in reliability compared to decennial Census data. Margins of error for many indicators are so high that conditions in one rural Alaska Census Area, let alone community, often cannot be distinguished statistically from those in another. This project meets this critical emerging information need by developing a set of statistically more robust social indicators for rural Alaska communities from the ACS and other sources. It takes advantage of the increased statistical power of the new indicators to test hypotheses about spatial differences and recent change in arctic social conditions that cannot be tested reliably with the published figures. The project will provide estimates and analysis to improve ACS estimates, reproducible methods for updating the indicator set periodically as new data became available over time, and recommendations for highest priority collection of new observations.","Long-term effects of group rights to resources: Evaluating the Western Alaska Community Development Quota program","Berman.

"The role of rising female labor force participation for inner-city gentrification","Gentrification is evident in a number of inner cities in the United States. Increasingly, families with young children are choosing city over suburban living. This study investigates the rise of dual-earner couples among high-income households as a driver of gentrification. This research hypothesizes that such families have high willingness-to-pay for a short commute (since there is no full-time homemaker) and therefore choose to locate close to work. Since skilled jobs are disproportionately located in city centers, the strive for a short commute results in gentrification of previously poverty stricken but centrally located areas. This project aggregates census tract-level information on household demographics from the Decennial Censuses and various years of the American Community Survey and matches to zip code-level real estate prices.","Bright Minds, Big Rent: Gentrification and the Rising Returns to Skill","Edlund, Lena, Cecilia Machado, and Maria Sviatschi. 2016. “Bright Minds, Big Rent: Gentrification and the Rising Returns to Skill.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 16-36.

"Latino Residential Segregation in the United States: Applying New Methods to Gain New Understandings","Census Bureau data are the primary source of information for residential segregation studies in the United States, but thus far researchers have been limited to studying aggregate level outcomes without being able to trace them back to the micro level social processes that drive these aggregate level patterns. Using new segregation measures which address and rectify methodological issues that have limited past research, this research will achieve these goals by demonstrating how it is now possible to study residential segregation at the micro and macro levels and how macro-level segregation is driven by micro-level social processes. In particular, this research will investigate the residential patterns of Latinos using new methodological techniques that will increase understandings of how individual social characteristics relate to residential outcomes for individuals, and how those outcomes in turn can be aggregated to generate measures of segregation at the city level. This project will also address the uncertainty of using the smaller American Community Survey samples for conducting in-depth analyses of residential segregation – analyses that could have once been explored using the data from the (now discontinued) long-form of the decennial census.","White-Latino Residential Attainments and Segregation in Six Cities: Assessing the Role of Micro-Level Factors","Crowell, Amber Fox, and Mark Fossett. 2016. “White-Latino Residential Attainments and Segregation in Six Cities: Assessing the Role of Micro-Level Factors.” Center for Economic Studies Discussion Paper 16-51.

"Bargaining power in firm-to-firm relationships","This project investigates the effects of bargaining power and long-term relationships on price setting in producer markets. One set of questions centers on the effect of bargaining power on the average price level and the size and frequency of price changes. For example, are sellers with more bargaining power able to charge higher prices for the same product? Another set of research questions concerns the connection between the average length of a relationship and bargaining power. For example, do relationships characterized by asymmetric bargaining power become more stable over time? Using transaction-level trade data involving U.S. firms, this research identifies both the buyer and the seller firm for import transactions. This feature makes it possible to determine in the import data whether firms are in an ongoing relationship with each other and to assess their relative bargaining power. Bargaining power is estimated using proxies for firms’ size, the ease with which they can find an alternative trading partner for the same product, and the uniqueness of the product traded.","Essays in Macroeconomics and International Trade","Heise, Sebastian. 2016.

"Bargaining power in firm-to-firm relationships","This project investigates the effects of bargaining power and long-term relationships on price setting in producer markets. One set of questions centers on the effect of bargaining power on the average price level and the size and frequency of price changes. For example, are sellers with more bargaining power able to charge higher prices for the same product? Another set of research questions concerns the connection between the average length of a relationship and bargaining power. For example, do relationships characterized by asymmetric bargaining power become more stable over time? Using transaction-level trade data involving U.S. firms, this research identifies both the buyer and the seller firm for import transactions. This feature makes it possible to determine in the import data whether firms are in an ongoing relationship with each other and to assess their relative bargaining power.

"Identifying Agglomeration Spillovers:  New Evidence from Large Plant Openings","The economic justification for local industrial strategies relies critically on the size and nonlinearity of agglomeration externalities as well as multiple equilibria. This project uses confidential Census micro data to test the economic justification for local industrial programs by examining the effect of “winning” the competition for a new large plant on incumbent plant productivity, testing for nonlinearity of the agglomeration function, and testing for evidence of multiple equilibria in county manufacturing shares. The first objective will be accomplished by the use of multiple sets of large plant openings to test spillover estimates for sensitivity to identification strategy. The project will investigate the sensitivity of productivity estimates to changes in the definition of output as well as sensitivity to inclusion of purchased services and to plant sample selection. The researchers will also assess aggregate efficacy by nonparametric estimation of the effect of local plant density on plant output in a partially linear regression model. Finally, the researchers will test whether the “winning” counties’ share of manufacturing and manufacturing industry output is best characterized by a single steady state spatial distribution, whereby counties’ return to their “pre-shock” levels, or multiple equilibria, whereby the shock permanently moves the distribution from its initial steady state to a new one. The proposed multiple equilibria analysis will be the first to use microdata, consider positive shocks to local industrial structure, and to do so within the United States.","Identifying Large Plant Spillovers: New Evidence from Large Plant Openings","Patrick, Carlianne and M.

"Demand and Supply Factors in Firm Dynamics","It is well established that most entering firms start small and take time to grow. However, less is known about the process of firm growth. This project attempts to understand the determinants of firm growth by identifying demand shocks separately from supply-side factors. Understanding the process of firm growth is important since it has a large effect on the allocation of resources across firms, and hence in the extent of allocative efficiency, which previous research suggests can explain a substantial portion of observed differences in output per worker across countries. The goal of this project is to understand the dynamics of firms by exploring alternative mechanisms of firm growth that do not depend solely on supply-side factors and to assess their quantitative relevance. To assess the contribution of demand side factors to firm growth, this project hopes to identify shocks that make it easier for a firm to sell to customers, relaxing the demand-side constraint to growth. The primary strategy for identifying demand shocks is to exploit variation in “customer access” across time, geographic space, and product lines. For instance, a firm that is exogenously assigned better access to customers should grow faster, if access to customers were a relevant constraint to growth.","Concentration and Foreign Sourcing in the U.S. Retail Sector","Dominic Smith, 2019.

"Cost Incentives, Trade-Induced Competitive Pressures, and Technology Adoption: Evidence from the U.S. Manufacturing Sector","Technological progress and innovation is arguably the largest factor that drives long-run economic growth. Many studies have shown that increasing competition from lowering trade barriers enhances efficiency and increases overall TFP growth. Nearly all these studies found that with an increase in competition, large productivity gains can be observed in the data, and that these gains account for a majority of the overall industry gains. However, the underlining mechanism that drives the overall TFP gain is not clear. A primary objective of this research is to examine the effect of increased trade-induced competition pressure and energy costs on technology adoption behavior of establishments. This research examines whether an increase in technology adoption is a main channel for an increase in TFP when firms face rising competitive pressure or rising energy costs.

"On The Margins of Firm Growth","This project will investigate economic growth at the establishment- and firm-level and seeks to dissect the evolution of the firm size distribution across locations, industries, and time. In doing so, the researchers will investigate the hypothesis of a structural change in the size distributions of firms and establishments and test existing theories of firm growth, providing much-needed empirical evidence that will form the basis for future theoretical work. The researchers will also extend their analysis to the establishment margin of firm growth and characterize the joint size distribution of firms and establishments. To the extent that the distributions of firm size and establishment size systematically co-move across industries and time, this research will document the properties of their joint distribution. Furthermore, since the distribution of establishment size and growth varies across locations, the researchers propose to study the geography of economic production and hope to shed light on the determinants and the effects of agglomeration on firm growth and the firm size distribution.","Heavy Tailed, but not Zipf: Firm and Establishment Size in the U.S.","Illenin O.

"Alternative Approaches to the Analysis of Complex Sample Survey Data: Applying State-of-the-Art Methods to NCSES Surveys","Secondary analyses of survey data sets collected from large probability samples of persons or establishments further scientific progress in many academic fields. The samples underlying these data sets, while enabling inferences about population characteristics or relationships between variables of interest in populations of interest, are often ""complex"" in nature, employing sampling strategies such as stratification of the population and cluster sampling. These complex sample design features improve data collection efficiency, but also complicate secondary analyses in terms of the approaches that need to be employed to account for the complex sampling statistically. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts of these data sets do not have formal training in survey statistics, and ultimately apply incorrect analytic methods when analyzing these data sets, which can lead to incorrect population inferences. This research project reviews published studies of National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) data sets to understand the statistical approaches that users of these data are currently employing, reviews the existing literature in survey statistics with regard to alternative design-based and model-based approaches that are appropriate for complex samples, and then applies these alternative approaches to several NCSES data sets, comparing the resulting inferences for a variety of statistical problems and educating data users about appropriate analytic methods.","The Need to Account for Complex Sampling Features when Analyzing Establishment Survey Data: An Illustration using the 2013 Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS)","West, Brady T., and Joseph W.

"How Does Market Access affect Entrepreneurship and Innovation?","This project exploits the exogenous variation in market access brought about by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and investigates the effect of cross-country integration on local economic scale in the U.S.-Canada border areas and its subsequent impact on entrepreneurial business formation, innovation, and firm births. The analysis then compares the effects of the U.S.-Canada FTA with other preferential trade agreements (PTAs) signed by the U.S. such as with Australia, Chile, Jordan, Mexico, and Singapore. The researchers use the Longitudinal Business Database, Economic Census, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD) to analyze the role of local market characteristics in promoting successful entrepreneurship and innovation. The analysis links trade transactions in the LFTTD and establishments in the Census of Manufacturers and Commodity Flow Survey to construct consistent yearly estimates of U.S. exports to compare data quality across the data sources at the plant level.","House Money and Entrepreneurship","Kerr, Sari, William R.

"Organizational Capital and Firm Value","This project studies the role of organizational capital using data from the newly available Management and Organization Practices Survey (MOPS). It examines the investment and distribution of organizational capital across firms and industries, how these investments interact with investments in physical capital, and ultimately how they are related to firm value and risk. The first set of questions is to understand how firms invest in organizational capital. How do managerial practices form and evolve over time in a firm? Do firms have similar practices in different units across industries and capital vintage? How does organizational capital interact with investments in physical capital? Do managerial practices and organizational structure influence financial decisions such as leverage and cash holdings? None of these questions have yet been thoroughly explored, and most of the existing evidence on managerial and organizational practices are anecdotal and difficult to compare across firms. The unique features of MOPS allow for addressing these questions. The second question is how organizational capital is related to firm risk. Part of the productive knowledge in the firm is accumulated in its employees, particularly managers and key talents. The organizational capital that is embedded in key employees (i.e., firm-specific human capital) is portable. The ultimate question is how organizational capital is related to firm value. Other research shows that good managerial practices correlate positively with firm productivity. However, identifying a causal effect of managerial practices on firm value can be very challenging. The problem will be addressed through two important corporate events – takeovers/acquisitions and shareholder activism.","What Do Unions Do? Incentives and Investments","Vojislav, M. and L.

"Trends and Processes of Hispanic Neighborhood Ascent in the U.S.","Hispanics comprise an increasing proportion of the U.S. population, particularly in urban areas, and thus profoundly shape urban neighborhoods. One recent phenomenon occurring in Hispanic neighborhoods is socioeconomic ascent--neighborhoods experiencing increases in residents' household income, rents, house values, educational and occupational attainment. This project seeks to understand the demographic processes underlying these changes using quantitative analyses of restricted-use Census and American Community Survey microdata on tracts in metropolitan areas in the U.S. Specifically, I will explore the demographic causes of Hispanic neighborhood socioeconomic ascent--whether ascent is due to long-time residents' fortunes improving, new residents moving in, or exit of longtime residents--and how these processes vary across metropolitan areas. Documenting these changes in Hispanic neighborhoods will provide a new perspective on inequality in metropolitan areas as the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse, and it will generate hypotheses for further research about how living in these neighborhoods is shaping the lives of Hispanics.","Racial/Ethnic Transition and Hierarchy Among Ascending Neighborhoods","Owens, Ann, and Jennifer Candipan. “Racial/Ethnic Transition and Hierarchy Among Ascending Neighborhoods,” Urban Affairs Review Vol 55, Issue 6, 2019","2019","USC",NA,"Owens, Ann, and Jennifer Candipan. “Racial/Ethnic Transition and Hierarchy Among Ascending Neighborhoods,” Urban Affairs Review Vol","2019",NA

This project will investigate two trends that potentially contribute to the decline in the percentage of U.S. workers covered by health insurance plans. The first is the rise of the new conception of employment, a shift in the employment contract between employers and employees that emphasizes market flexibility, short‐term commitments, and focuses on increasing shareholder value. The second is the decline in labor unions, decreasing the bargaining power of workers and potentially decreasing labor’s ability to argue that health insurance is a vital component of compensation.","Union, Premium Cost, and the Provision of Employment-Based Health Insurance","Lin, Ken-Hou, Samuel Bondurant, and Andrew Messamore. “Union, Premium Cost, and the Provision of Employment-Based Health Insurance.” Socius, (January 2018). https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023118798502.","2018","Austin",NA,"Lin, Ken-Hou, Samuel Bondurant, and Andrew Messamore. “Union, Premium Cost, and the Provision of Employment-Based Health Insurance.” Socius,","2018","10.1177/2378023118798502."

"Exploring How Transportation Infrastructure Affects Commuting Behaviors of Individuals and Locality Decisions of Business Establishments :  A Longitudinal Quasi-Experimental Study in the United States","This research seeks to understand how transit improvements affect the commuting behaviors of individuals and the location decisions of business establishments. Many U.S. cities are making substantial investments in expanding their public transit systems and promoting transit-oriented developments in hopes of reducing vehicle miles driven and in making neighborhoods more compact, economically vibrant, and transit accessible. The researchers will perform before-after, experimental or quasi-experimental analyses that can better illuminate the causal impact of transportation infrastructure investments on the economy and society. This is a two-phase process. In phase one, they analyze patterns of commuting behavior before and after the opening of new light rail transit (LRT) stations. They construct a quasi-experimental setting by using the American Community Survey (ACS) microdata and the propensity score matching technique. In phase two, they study the location behavior of business establishments due to LRT openings by analyzing microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) for three metropolitan areas: Dallas, Los Angeles, and Charlotte.","Examining the Effects of New Transit Lines on Commuting Using Restricted-Access Census Microdata","Li, Wei and Zhong, Haotian and Boarnet, Marlon G.

"Exploring How Transportation Infrastructure Affects Commuting Behaviors of Individuals and Locality Decisions of Business Establishments :  A Longitudinal Quasi-Experimental Study in the United States","This research seeks to understand how transit improvements affect the commuting behaviors of individuals and the location decisions of business establishments. Many U.S. cities are making substantial investments in expanding their public transit systems and promoting transit-oriented developments in hopes of reducing vehicle miles driven and in making neighborhoods more compact, economically vibrant, and transit accessible. The researchers will perform before-after, experimental or quasi-experimental analyses that can better illuminate the causal impact of transportation infrastructure investments on the economy and society. This is a two-phase process. In phase one, they analyze patterns of commuting behavior before and after the opening of new light rail transit (LRT) stations. They construct a quasi-experimental setting by using the American Community Survey (ACS) microdata and the propensity score matching technique. In phase two, they study the location behavior of business establishments due to LRT openings by analyzing microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) for three metropolitan areas: Dallas, Los Angeles, and Charlotte.","Rail transit and economic growth: documenting evidences from a panel data analysis of eighteen metropolitan areas in the United States","Li, W., Rosenheim, N.P., Dong, H., Boarnet, M.G. and Zhong, H.

"Improving the quality of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Police Public Contact Survey in order to better understand the determinates of help-seeking behavior among victims of intimate-partner and sexual assaults","There is a rich literature examining the factors associated with help-seeking behaviors among victims of crime. However, the ability to draw conclusions from this body of research is hampered by small, highly selective (biased)  samples of victims and/or a limited focus on incident and individual-level factors. One implication is a dearth of information on the general and specific effects of socio-cultural factors that likely influence reporting behaviors among victims of violent crimes. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) contains a nationally representative sample of persons ages 12 and over and has the potential to overcome prior limitations by examining whether victims of intimate partner and sexual violence engage in two types of formal help-seeking behavior: reporting and accessing victim services. In addition to detailed information on incident and victim characteristics, the NCVS also contains geographic identifiers that enable a researcher to link incident-level and individual-level information with contextual factors such as proactive justice policies, resource availability, and community attitudes, in order to estimate how socio-cultural factors influence the help seeking pathways of victims of intimate partner and sexual assault.","Community Level Resources Help-seeking Behavior for Intimate Partner Violence","Willyard, Katherine, and Augustyn, Megan Bears.

"Child support law and the marital and fertility decisions of couples","This project will assess the social and economic landscape of single-parent households and their relationship with the non-resident parent, a subject of great importance given the large fraction of children born into out-of-wedlock households. The project also proposes to analyze the quality of marriage and fertility data contained in the Census Bureau's internal-use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Specifically, the researcher will analyze the quality of aggregate marriage and fertility statistics in SIPP as compared to those based on natality data from birth certificates published in the National Vital Statistics System; study the reliability of identifying “shotgun” marriages in the public-use SIPP, without knowledge of the month of marriage or the month of birth as is available in the internal-use SIPP; analyze the aggregate social and economic behavior of non-resident fathers, including their labor force participation, and their time and child support expenditures on their children; and analyze the aggregated reports by mothers of child support receipt compared to aggregated reports by fathers of child support expenditures.","The Effect of Child Support on Selection into Marriage and Fertility","Daniel I.

"Forecasting Income Inequality in the United States","This study chooses models to best forecast several inequality measures, provide short-term forecasts, and examine the changing nature of the income distribution over the course of a year, as affected by survey design and business cycles. This research builds off a preliminary exercise with public-use data from the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to model and forecast income inequality. Extending that analysis with the use of restricted-access CPS data will improve earlier income inequality measures. Internally topcoded data will enable the researcher to accurately model the income distribution and provide better forecasts, as the majority of the changes in income inequality have occurred in the top income percentiles, i.e., precisely those data which are topcoded. This research also examines how the income distribution changes over the course of the year. The researcher will compare results obtained from the CPS March supplement to the rolling data available from the American Community Survey, administered monthly. Given the timing of the CPS survey (shortly before the tax filing deadline) and the number of questions on various income sources for the past calendar year, estimates obtained using the CPS are judged to most accurately represent the true income distribution of the United States.","Towards a Distribution of Household Income: Linking Survey Data to Administrative Data","Fixler, Dennis, Marina Gindelsky, and David Johnson. 2018.

"Energy and the Environment - Exploring Plant Level Production Decisions","This project will determine the extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulation regimes influence firm-level production. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods compares how “clean” versus “dirty” industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, using firm- and plant-level data, this project recognizes that even within a narrowly defined industry, firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error and/or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces. This project will investigate the relationship between firms and environmental regulatory regimes over the past 40 years.","Regulating Mismeasured Pollution: Implications of Firm Heterogeneity for Environmental Policy","Lyubich, Eva, Joseph S.

"Energy and the Environment - Exploring Plant Level Production Decisions","This project will determine the extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulation regimes influence firm-level production. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods compares how “clean” versus “dirty” industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, using firm- and plant-level data, this project recognizes that even within a narrowly defined industry, firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error and/or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces. This project will investigate the relationship between firms and environmental regulatory regimes over the past 40 years.","Consequences of the Clean Water Act and the Demand for Water Quality","Keiser, David A., and Joseph S.

"The Role of Firm Size and Age on Employment and Hours Adjustments","This project will examine and compare the establishment-level responses of labor demand to productivity and business cycle fluctuations using the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), Census of Manufactures (CM), and the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (QPC). The growth rates of production hours per worker, revenue, and employment by establishment size and age classification will be calculated for both the QPC and ASM/CM. The research will document the correlation of these establishment-class growth rates in hours, productivity, and employment with aggregate and regional business conditions. Using multiple econometric techniques, the project will document the differences in volatility, correlation, and magnitudes of the hours and employment adjustments of establishments by age and size categories. The study will also provide estimates for the revenue productivity of establishments in the ASM/CM data, controlling for the endogeneity of productivity and intermediate input demand. In addition, this project will examine the quality of voluntary responses in the QPC relative to the mandatory ASM/CM in several ways.","The Effects of the Real Oil Price on Regional Wage Dispersion","Kehrig, Matthias, and Nicolas L.

"How Destructive Is Innovation?","This project will use the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and Longitudinal Business Database to shed light on the underlying sources of innovation, where innovation potentially comes from three sources. In particular, firms grow when they improve on products made by other firms (creative destruction), when they innovate on products that they currently produce (own innovation), and when they invent brand new products (new varieties). Each mechanism will leave specific telltale signs in the microdata. In particular, they will generate different patterns of firm exit with respect to the size of the firm, for the number of products made by the firm, the volatility of firm growth, the size distribution of firms, and how the size distribution evolves with firm age.

"Should My Car Move or Should I?  A Model of Residential and Commuting Choices","Communities across the country are implementing policies to address their increasing commuter congestion. These policies are relatively new and vary from city to city, so not much is known about their full effects. To evaluate different congestion reduction policies, this project will develop a discrete choice structural model of the joint decision of individual residence and commuting mode, given the characteristics of the housing market and commuting options. The model is estimated for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area using individual-level, restricted-access data from the 1996-2013 American Community Surveys (ACS), which includes information on where individuals live and work, together with data on the structure of the transportation network, to map each individual’s optimal commute for each option in the individual's choice set. The mappings will create a dataset of commute options and characteristics that will be used to estimate the trade-offs that individuals make among consumption, housing amenities, and leisure when choosing a home and commuting mode pair. The model estimates will be used to simulate the effects of transportation policies that alter the financial and time costs of commuting. These policies include congestion pricing schemes, fuel or carbon taxes, and increased parking fees.","Should My Car Move or Should I?

"Geographic Variation in ACA-Related Media Messages and Health Insurance Enrollment","This project examines the relationship between media messages about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health insurance enrollment. The researchers first examine the associations between media market-level characteristics of broadcast media and the market-level socio-demographics of the populations plausibly exposed to those media in late 2013. They then examine the associations between the volume and tone of media messages about the ACA with changes in insurance enrollment from 2013 to 2014/2015. They do so by estimating individual-level models of insurance coverage on indicator variables for the post-ACA period interacted with the market-level variables and a host of state- and county-level controls. The study will contribute new understanding of an important health issue: the influence of news and advertising media on insurance enrollment during the implementation of the ACA.","The volume of TV advertisements during the ACA’s first enrollment period was associated with increased insurance coverage","Karaca-Mandic, P., Wilcock, A., Baum, L., Barry, C.

"Firm Disclosure Costs, Private Equity, and the Decision to Stay Private","This research will explore the tradeoff faced by firms in choosing to remain privately incorporated or to tap public markets and whether the possibility of tapping private equity financing plays a role in this tradeoff. Is the proprietary cost of disclosure an important consideration in the decision of a firm to go public or stay private, and is private equity financing an important facilitator of large firms with high funding needs staying private in order to avoid high proprietary disclosure costs? This project will identify firms in both the Business Register and the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) that are also in portfolios of private equity funds (also called “financial sponsors”). This research will produce descriptive statistics on how such portfolio companies differ from firms that are publicly held or held by other types of private owners, such as age, size (as measured by sales and assets), industry composition, growth, as well as their product and service innovation strategies.

"The Impact of Information Technology, Management Practices, and Innovation on Environmental Performance","This research will examine the effect of regulation on various organizational outcomes, such as output and productivity, and their resulting effect on environmental performance. Our analysis will explore how environmental regulations, such as the Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems, arising out of the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act and the Cluster Rule, affect organizational outcomes like expenditures on information technology (IT), changes in management practices, firm-level innovations in production processes and services, innovation intensities, and rates of technology transfer. Heterogeneity in organizational outcomes across industries, types of innovation, firm characteristics, and plant characteristics like size, age, and location will also be explored. Additionally, we will analyze how changes in these organizational outcomes affect environmental performance as measured by the TRI emissions data as well as Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey data. Establishment-level data on IT expenditures will be used from the Information and Communication Technology Survey, Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, Computer Network Use Survey, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures.

"Understanding the growth dynamics of firms and regions: Clusters, entrepreneurial quality, and regional prosperity over the business cycle","This project examines the resilience of regions and firms in the context of the recent Great Recession and prior economic recessions. When faced with a negative economic shock, the presence of clusters – geographic concentrations of related industries, firms, and supporting institutions – in a region could mitigate the effects of the negative shock. Agglomeration economies arise in regional clusters of related economic activity, and the interconnection of industries (and associated firms) could facilitate a faster recovery from a recession. Using data from the U.S. Cluster Mapping Project (USCMP) and the Longitudinal Business Database, this projects examines whether industries in strong clusters experience faster growth (as measured by employment, wage, entrepreneurship, innovation or productivity) before, during, and/or after the recession period than industries located in weak clusters. A related aspect of regional (and firm) resilience is the ability of a region or firm to diversify and re-invent itself. This project examines the role of related economic diversifications on the recovery of regions and firms. Further, the distribution of economic success within regions is often uneven, and pockets of concentrated poverty and high unemployment rates persist in American cities. Using data from the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, the USCMP, and the Census Bureau, this projects explores whether clusters matter for the performance of inner cities, investigating if integrating inner cities into the cluster composition of their regions would lead to more effective employment outcomes.","The Servicification of the U.S. Economy: The Role of Startups versus Incumbent Firms","Delgado, Mercedes, Daniel Kim, and Karen Mills, 2021. “The Servicification of the U.S. Economy: The Role of Startups versus Incumbent Firms,”  in Aaron Chatterji, Josh Lerner, Scott Stern, and Michael J.

"The Economic Effects of Firm Incentives and Improvements in Census Bureau Sampling Weights","This project analyzes the effects of production subsidies on local and aggregate economic development outcomes. Exploiting a seven-year $800 million subsidy lottery in California's film industry that sorted hundreds of establishments across cities of varying industrial concentration in film, the project studies how production incentives affect establishment location decisions and their associated impact on local wages, employment, municipal revenue, and productivity. Placing these estimates of subsidy benefits in a spatial equilibrium framework, the second part of this study examines the cost-side of attracting employers with local incentives by characterizing the welfare effects of fiscal competition between municipalities. Finally, the project leverages a policy change in 2014 that reformed the subsidy allocation mechanism from a lottery system to a ""jobs-impact"" ranking formula, providing an ideal laboratory for examining whether subsidy lotteries generate misallocation costs, compared to deliberate employment-based allocation mechanisms.","Firm Responses to State Hiring Subsidies: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from a Tax Credit Formula","Benjamin G.

"Do Shocks Abroad Shift Supply Curves in the U.S.?","This project aims to assess whether economic, political, and natural disaster shocks abroad promoted migration from developing countries to the United States (and its states and municipalities) from 1960 until the present.

"Analysis and Report on Individuals Who are Eligible for but Not Enrolled in the Medicare Savings","Medicare Savings Programs (MSP) provide financial assistance to participants for Medicare premiums and, in some cases, required cost sharing for medical services covered by Medicare. However, the rate of participation in these programs, as well as the individual characteristics associated with participation, is not well understood. This is in part because household surveys administered by the Census Bureau and other entities do not collect information on MSP participation, and administrative sources that identify MSP enrollment clearly exclude those eligible but not enrolled. This research attempts to fill this gap in data collection by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked with administrative data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The administrative data will serve as the means to identify MSP enrollees among SIPP respondents, while the SIPP will identify the MSP eligible population using survey data on income, assets, and state of residence. Using these linked data, this work will study participation in the MSP programs and factors that influence participation.","Medicare Savings Program Enrollees and Eligible Non-Enrollees","Caswell, Kyle J. and Timothy A.

"Why do variety-adjusted price indices vary substantially across locations?","This project investigates competing explanations provided by the economic geography literature on why variety-adjusted price indices vary substantially across locations. In the presence of trade costs, more producers locate in larger cities, which implies that larger cities produce more consumer products and have lower price indices. As more productive firms are located in larger cities and more producers locate in larger cities, larger cities are characterized by lower price as firms charge lower markup. Moreover, these theories only consider the way heterogeneity in manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations drives the number of products available to consumers, abstracting from the role of non-manufacturing industries and the growing share of imported goods relative to the ones sourced domestically. Measurement of the productivity growth in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing services sectors is difficult because it is hard to measure the prices of outputs that firms sell, the prices of inputs they use, and identify whether the products sold are sourced domestically or are imported from abroad. Moreover, there has been no research investigating the link between the heterogeneity in non-manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations and the number of domestically sourced or imported products available. This is mainly because it has been difficult to obtain data on the prices of products sold by a given retailer in a given U.S. location and the number of products imported, and sold at a given U.S. location. Therefore, this project aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a unified framework in which the previously mentioned explanations can be separated and quantified by using restricted Census microdata.","Aggregating from Micro to Macro Patterns of Trade","Redding, Stephen J., and David E.

"Payroll Rigidity, Employment and Investment throughout the Business Cycle","Wage rigidity has long been hypothesized by many economists as an important amplifier of business cycles, but the empirical evidence on this conjecture is limited. We aim to provide empirical tests of this conjecture by studying the relationship between payroll flexibility and employment and investment volatility at the firmlevel. We will measure pay and wage rigidity precisely in the microdata, and then study how differences in rigidity affect firm employment and investment outcomes in the face of business cycle or industrylevel shocks.

"Ethnicity and Interview Language in the NCVS: An Analysis of Response Patterns, Data Quality, and Experiences with Crime","This project uses internal National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data from 1996-2014 that include geographic codes (i.e., zip codes, census tracts, and counties), along with NCVS language files from 2007-2014 that include the interview language for respondents. While the publicly-available NCVS data provide a rich set of indicators, including the racial and ethnic identity of respondents in some detail, no additional items are available that might further illuminate potentially important nuances in experiences with crime or the police among ethnic minorities who differ on levels of acculturation to American society. Linking these data to the core internal NCVS files would yield valuable insights, both for the nature and quality of data collected in non-English interviews, and for scientific understanding of how language proficiency may shape victimization risk and decisions to notify the police.","Neighborhood Immigrant Concentration and Violence Crime Reporting to the Police: A Multilevel Analysis of Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey","Xie, Min, and Eric P.

"Productivity and Wage Dispersion in the Great Recession and Beyond","This project will investigate the extent of labor hoarding versus productivity change by establishments and firms during the Great Recession, and differences in responses compared to prior recessions and across sectors. The first part analyses the response of firms and establishments to the changes in total industry demand during the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. We will also contrast job loss and closure between firms that invest heavily in intangible capital, such as R&D, and those that invest less. Our analysis of the Census data prior to the GR showed a huge widening of the distribution of average wages of firms and of establishments in the same firm. We will assess whether there is greater heterogeneity in employment responses among firms and establishments within firms than in the past, and the characteristics of the observed heterogeneity. A novel feature is that we will add measures of occupational status and human capital to the establishments. Using measures of sales, capital input, employment, material inputs and wages we plan to look more carefully into the productivity dispersion, employment and wage dispersion across establishments in general. First we want to establish and analyze the rent sharing behavior of firms. We will develop this literature further, providing estimates of rent sharing for different types of employees, both in terms of occupation, gender and in terms of educational level.

The existence of a wide distribution of wages across establishments, even for the same worker, raises questions of the performance of the labor market, and why market forces do not work to eliminate these wage differentials. The behavior of employers thus seems to indicate that there are large frictions in labor markets. One way of studying such frictions is to study job-to-job transitions. We plan to study the relationship between the wage distribution across establishments and job-to-job transitions over time and between different types of workers. Furthermore, worker flows across firms and establishments create direct connections between various organizational units. These connections provide possible avenues for information flows and spillovers between firms. We will study the interconnectedness between firms and establishments as means of both knowledge transfer and as instruments for measuring the competitiveness of the economy.","Twisting the Demand Curve: Digitalization and the Older Workforce","Barth, Erling, James Davis, Richard Freeman and Kristina McElheran (2020). “Twisting the Demand Curve: Digitalization and the Older Workforce.” CES Working Paper CES-WP-20-37.","2020","Boston",NA,"Barth, Erling, James Davis, Richard Freeman and Kristina McElheran","2020",NA

"Human Capital and Corporate Financing, Restructuring, and Governance","This research describes how corporate financing and restructuring activities impact firms, workers, and human capital. We use the Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, and other economic datasets linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics to conduct several empirical analyses. First, we estimate the decline in wages and the employee human capital loss resulting from corporate bankruptcy. Next, we estimate the effects of corporate restructuring activities on establishment- or worker-level outcomes such as productivity, employment, and wages. Examples of restructuring activities include investment by venture capital firms or private equity firms and changes in industry concentration. We also analyze the effects of corporate governance/ownership structure on firm or worker outcomes such as Tobin’s Q, capital structure, wages, and labor productivity. Further, we estimate the effects of changes in an establishment’s location. Using the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to identify firms and establishments in the U.S. importing or exporting goods from foreign subsidiaries, we estimate the effects of off- and reshoring of plants on plant- and worker-level outcomes, such as productivity and wages. In addition, we use the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey to estimate the effect of changes in firm or establishment location on capital expenditures. Finally, we estimate the role of unions in shaping the sensitivity of wages to productivity and analyze how changes in industry market concentration affect the worker-level outcomes such as wages.","Shareholder Power and the Decline of Labor","Falato, Antonio, Hyunseob Kim, and Till von Wachter, 2021, “Shareholder Power and the Decline of Labor.” Mimeo.","2021","Chicago",NA,"Falato, Antonio, Hyunseob Kim, and Till von Wachter,","2021",NA

Confidential Census data is necessary to examine the lotteries because H-1B visas were randomly awarded to individuals with employment agreements with U.S. firms. Because firms span geographical boundaries, the effects that occur within firms may dissipate when analyzing more aggregate units of observation.

"Migration Trajectories of International Students in the United States","This project examines the migration trajectories of international students in the United States, using a combination of restricted-use data from the National Survey of College Graduates, the American Community Survey, and the Decennial Census long form. The research addresses two sets of questions. First, what are the patterns of international students’ spatial mobility within the United States, and what explains these patterns? Second, what are the patterns of migration status trajectories for international students in the United States, and what are the consequences of these patterns? The project will generate estimates for the likelihood that international students would move out of the location where they get the first U.S. degrees, and will examine how different contextual characteristics are associated with the likelihood of moving. Additionally, the research will examine the types of educational, spatial, and visa type trajectories that international students experienced while in the United States. These findings will help answer several important lingering questions concerning the retention of international students in places as well as the duration and steps involved in their migration experiences.","Immigration Policy and International Student Migration in the United States","Ha, Jasmine Trang. 2019.

"Outside Employment Options","This project will examine workers and businesses when workers face differential outside employment opportunities. The researchers will investigate how decisions by workers impact future firm performance and other firm and establishment outcomes, as well as the effects of those opportunities on employee labor market outcomes such as the choice of employer and current/future earnings and tenure. The researchers will explore whether workers employed by firms facing competitive employment pressures are more likely to leave for other employment and whether such firms raise wages in an effort to retain workers. The researchers will investigate the impact on firm outcomes created when firms employ certain kinds of workers and the implications of these wage decisions for future firm performance. Finally, this research will examine key firm characteristics that may either mitigate or exacerbate the relationships described above.","Firms with Benefits? Nonwage Compensation and

"The Consequences of Firm-Level Wage Compression","Using the LEHD and ACS data, this project explores firm-level wage compression, a practice in which lower productivity workers are paid more while higher productivity workers are paid less. This research will document how prevalent wage compression is in the U.S. economy, as well as the relationship between wage compression and the cyclical properties of nominal wages and the recent trends in earnings inequality. For example, wage compression within the firm may be related to the cyclical properties of the labor market if firms with more wage compression are more attune to fairness concerns and, therefore, are less likely to drop their wages in response to negative economic shocks. Furthermore, if there are differences in wage compression across firms, high ability workers will likely want to sort into the firms with less wage compression, and lower ability individuals will want to sort into higher wage compression firms where they are paid more. These incentives will lead to an increase in the sorting of workers across firms over time. Additionally, it may be that firms share their profits with workers, and that, because of fairness concerns, the firm shares the economic profits with all of its workers. Wage compression within the firm, therefore, affects how much differences in profits across firms can explain the rise in between-firm wage variability, even for people at the bottom of the skill distribution.","The Matching Multiplier and the Amplification of Recessions","Patterson, Christina, “The Matching Multiplier and the Amplification of Recessions,” MIT mimeo, 2018.

"Wells and Wellbeing: How the Shale Energy Revolution is Changing Rural Families","Advancements in oil and gas drilling have led to a rapid expansion of shale energy production across the United States. While increased domestic energy production has important strategic implications for the country as a whole, the most profound impacts may be on the small towns and rural areas where the energy extraction is occurring. Much work has been done to estimate the economic and environmental impacts of shale energy development, yet little empirical work has assessed its impact on family outcomes and community demographic composition. We use restricted access American Community Survey microdata from 2006–2014 to estimated difference-in-differences models of shale energy development on family processes. Family outcomes of interest include fertility (marital and nonmarital), marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and migration. We do not expect shale development to have progressed long enough to have a measurable impact on overall fertility rates. However, nonmarital fertility is more closely associated with short-term individual level economic, so we expect shale development to significantly impact nonmarital fertility.","Social Change in Shale O&G Communities","Shepard, M.

"Natural Disasters, Recessions and Adaptive Capacity","What factors determine the adaptive capacity of organizations or the economy, when faced with unanticipated disruptive events? This research examines how the performance of establishments, firms, and the economy is affected by unanticipated shocks, including natural disasters and business cycle movements. This research aims to discern the characteristics of plants, firms, and local economies that determine their capacity to effectively respond – through adjustments in behavior, resource utilization, and technologies – to disruptions. Furthermore, this research will examine how responses to disruptions differ depending on the frequency and intensity of the disruption. For example, economic disasters such as recessions are infrequent, affect everyone, and are costly to the economy. There have only been five since the 1970s, but they have been widely studied and documented to be highly damaging. In contrast, natural disasters are more frequent in occurrence, local to certain geographies, and exhibit large variation in the extent of damage. While the economy-wide impact of natural disasters has also been studied, there exists limited plant- and firm-level evidence on the consequences of such frequent, unpredictable disasters; on the extent to which their impact differs from the repercussions of economic disasters; and the various characteristics that may determine the capacity to respond and adapt to uncertain and disruptive events.","Essays on Firms and Networks in the Economy","Seetharam, Ishuwar.

"Production, Energy Use, and Employment Decisions in Response to Changes in Energy Production, Environmental Factors, and the Business Environment","Significant heterogeneity exists in energy markets and the business environment across the United States. States and regions have adopted different strategies to address both the challenges of supplying electricity and the negative externalities associated with its production (e.g., emissions, pollutants).

"The Impact of Accounting Frauds on Labor Markets","Prior studies have investigated the effect of accounting fraud on various parties, including investors, top managers, consumers, and peer firms. However, the impact of accounting fraud on labor markets has received little attention, likely because of data limitations. The question this study addresses is whether the labor market outcomes of employees of accounting fraud firms could have been different if those firms had not been involved in accounting fraud. Using data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, Longitudinal Business Database, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures, we examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. These data sets allow us to track employee information, such as wages and job switches, over time. To analyze the employment effects, we combine Census Bureau data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting. We find that, compared to a matched sample, employee wages decline during and after fraud, and that employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative after. During fraud, managers overinvest in labor. Frauds cause informational opacity, and fraudulent reports tend to indicate good prospects, encouraging employees to still join the firm. After the fraud is revealed and the overemployment is unwound, employee wages fall due to turnover, with related job-search challenges and losses of firm-specific investments, and the stigma associated with the fraud. We use various subsamples to provide evidence for these mechanisms, showing that labor market disruptions and stigma have meaningful and negative consequences for employees.","Fraudulent Financial Reporting and the Consequences for Employees","Choi, Jung Ho, and Brandon Gipper, 2019.

"Trade Exposure and Firm Dynamics","This project examines the role of increased trade exposure in the decline of entrepreneurship and the consequences for aggregate employment and productivity growth. This research is motivated by the burgeoning recent literature documenting that the rise in import competition from China and other low wage countries in the early 2000s has exerted important negative effects on employment, while simultaneously leading to increased technical change within firms and reallocation of employment towards more productive firms. This project addresses a set of important questions that have so far been left unexplored: What are the effects of increased trade exposure on startup rates and the post-entry dynamics of firms in terms of survival and employment growth? What is the role of offshoring in explaining these employment effects?

"Searching, matching, and the transfer of information in international trade relationships","This study examines the establishment and evolution of firms’ international trading relationships at the transaction level using a novel “two-sided” firm trade transactions dataset which, for the period 1992 through 2011, links U.S. importers from the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to exporters from Korean firm-level data provided by a Korean credit agency. This research exploits the unique ownership structure of Korean firms, the majority of which operate under the control of a business group. Specifically, this study tests for evidence of export spillovers for firms within the same ownership structure and estimates the degree of information transfer. The researchers hypothesize that firms with more information about a foreign market face lower costs in building new trade relationships abroad. Thus, with the transfer of information and market-specific knowledge, firms should benefit from being in business groups where member companies have more trade relationships. Furthermore, this impact may be even stronger if a Korean company has a foreign affiliate in the United States. The project also examines whether the sharing of information was helpful during the recent global financial crisis in avoiding the loss of exports at the intensive margin and the loss of trading relationships at the extensive margin.","Record linkage using Stata: Preprocessing, linking, and reviewing utilities","Wasi, Nada and Aaron Flaaen.

"Can Financial Factors Explain Aggregate Productivity? Evidence from U.S. Establishments","This research examines whether financial factors can explain the allocation of employment and capital across firms, and how that allocation affects aggregate productivity growth. Recent research has shown that differences in the allocation of resources across firms can explain differences in aggregate productivity across countries. Comparatively little research has focused on changes in the allocation of resources within a country, over time, or on the forces that affect this re-allocation. This projects seeks to answer three main questions. First, what determines a firm’s debt-to-asset ratio (leverage)? Second, what is the relationship between leverage and growth in the size of the firm? Third, what is the role of firm financial structure in aggregate productivity growth?","Decomposing Aggregate Productivity","Pancost, N. Aaron and Chen Yeh. ""Decomposing Aggregate Productivity.""

"The Employment and Wage Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions","This project will investigate wage and employment effects of mergers and acquisitions, and use mergers to test the law of one price in labor market. SDC Platinum and Compustat data will be merged using the SSEL to LEHD data, and an analysis of the data quality of firm dynamics in Title 13, Chapter 5 data will be analyzed. Estimates of the population will include results from semi-parametric difference-in-difference statistical estimates of the effects of M&As on target firms' employment and wage outcomes, and for public firms on post-merger stock price gains. The empirical framework will support testing if results are consistent with a ""breach of trust"" view of the relationship of workers and employers, where firms with a higher wage premium would experience a larger wage decline after the merger. Alternatively, if firm pay premiums reflect productivity differences, and workers are paid more at productive firms due to potential rent sharing, then a target firm that is acquired by a firm with higher wage premiums should experience an increase in wages. Estimates will also explore the effect of M&A on employment and earnings trajectories of workers in target firms over time.","Eclipse of Rent-Sharing: The Effects of Managers' Business Education on Wages and the Labor Share in the US and Denmark","Xi He, Daron Acemoglu, Daniel le Maire, March 2022, ""Eclipse of Rent-Sharing: The Effects of Managers' Business Education on Wages and the Labor Share in the US and Denmark"".

"Trade-Induced Spillovers and Reallocation Across Firms","This research investigates the adverse effects of import competition on exposed workers, firms, and local labor markets, both on firms that compete directly with foreign producers, as well as through several indirect channels whose relative importance is not yet known. This project poses three questions. First, what are the predominant mechanisms through which trade shocks impact aggregate employment and output? Alongside direct effects, we evaluate two leading explanations for trade-induced job losses: aggregate demand effects and propagation through input-output linkages. Second, how do trade shocks affect the allocation of economic activity across firms? Theoretical models of firm-level dynamics suggest that the effects of both direct and indirect import exposure on entry, exit, and factor demands should vary systematically with a firm’s initial productivity, exporting status, size, and age. These heterogeneous treatment effects, if present, could give rise to economically important reallocation in response to trade shocks. Finally, what are the effects of negative shocks, such as import exposure, on firm and establishment survey non-response in Census Bureau surveys and censuses?","The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms","Autor, David, David Dorn, Lawrence F.

"Common Ownership and Firm Dynamics: Measuring Employment, Wage, and Firm Performance Outcomes","This research examines the effect of concentrated ownership on employment, wages, productivity, and firm dynamics. The project will create a new bridge linking Compustat, the Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund and Institutional Owners database, and the Levenstein and Suslow (2016) data on interfirm cooperation to the Census Bureau’s Business Register. These databases provide detailed information on the shareholders of firms and the controlling financial interest that links firms. Combining these data with market share information from Census Bureau data allows the construction of generalized HHI market concentration measures. The researchers will analyze employment and productivity-related outcomes by comparing highly concentrated markets to less concentrated markets and will estimate the effects of their market concentration measure on the outcomes noted above.","Measuring  the  Effects  of  Firm  Uncertainty  on  Economic  Activity:  New  Evidence from One Million Documents","Handley, Kyle and J.

"Common Ownership and Firm Dynamics: Measuring Employment, Wage, and Firm Performance Outcomes","This research examines the effect of concentrated ownership on employment, wages, productivity, and firm dynamics. The project will create a new bridge linking Compustat, the Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund and Institutional Owners database, and the Levenstein and Suslow (2016) data on interfirm cooperation to the Census Bureau’s Business Register. These databases provide detailed information on the shareholders of firms and the controlling financial interest that links firms. Combining these data with market share information from Census Bureau data allows the construction of generalized HHI market concentration measures. The researchers will analyze employment and productivity-related outcomes by comparing highly concentrated markets to less concentrated markets and will estimate the effects of their market concentration measure on the outcomes noted above.","Labor Market Concentration does not Explain the Falling Labor Share","Lipsius, Ben. 2018.

"Management, uncertainty and firm performance","There is substantial dispersion in productivity across establishments in the United States. Management is an important factor in explaining differences in productivity, as is the role of economic uncertainty and firm expectations, which drive micro and macro performance. This research will quantify the roles of these factors and evaluate their causes and effects, using data from the Management and Organizational Practices Survey, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Census of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database, and other economic censuses and surveys. We will evaluate management practices and uncertainty across plants, firms, regions, and industries; examine channels through which management and uncertainty affect performance; and identify key factors driving uncertainty, as well as the adoption of better management practices in organizations. This analysis will allow us to evaluate whether establishments that have more structured management, more stable organizational environments, and better forecasting have superior performance, less short-termism, and less sensitivity to transitory shocks.","Skewed Business Cycles","Bloom, Nicholas & Fatih Guvenen & Sergio Salgado, 2016.

"Neighborhood Migration and the Reproduction of Residential Segregation","Residential segregation by race and income is an enduring feature of the landscape of American metropolitan areas. Despite some declines over the last forty years, in 2010, almost two-thirds of black households and half of Hispanic households would have had to move to achieve complete integration with the white population. Income segregation, on the other hand, has increased over time and has accelerated over the last decade. The endurance of residential segregation is particularly interesting given the high rates of residential mobility among American households. In fact, half of all households in the U.S. change residences over a five-year period. The scope, scale, and predictors of the geographic mobility of households have evolved over time and have varied across metropolitan areas. Much less is known, however, about how households choose where to move. This project will use discrete choice models that frame geographic mobility as a multidimensional process where the decision to move is modelled using an extensive set of neighborhood characteristics. The estimates will show the probability of moving to a neighborhood given the socioeconomic characteristics of a household and given the socioeconomic characteristics of potential neighborhood destinations within a metropolitan area. The discrete choice models will be used to simulate the conditions of residential mobility that can achieve lower levels of residential segregation. This research may generate important insights into how changing geographic mobility across racial and income groups can also change aggregate segregation levels by race and income.","What Would It Take to Desegregate U.S. Metropolitan Areas?

"Civil service reforms - evidence from US municipalities","This research examines the effects of civil service reforms on municipal bureaucracies and their performance. Historically, public administration in the United States was characterized by a spoils system in which elected politicians had the power to hire and fire bureaucrats. Provisions aimed at professionalizing the bureaucracy were first introduced at the federal level and slowly diffused to lower levels of government. These reforms were characterized by both meritocratic hiring and political protections for public employees. These reforms may select in better workers through competitive entrance requirements but reduce performance incentives through tenure. This projects examines those states that mandated cities to institute civil service boards for police and fire departments based on population thresholds. This research exploits these thresholds in a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of introducing the merit system. First, using data from the decennial censuses of 1960 to 2000, this projects looks at the effect on the demographic composition of police and fire departments and, in particular, the gender, age, and racial composition of these department, together with the educational level of policemen and firemen. Second, this research studies whether the reforms had effects on the performance of these departments, including crime rates.","Civil Service Reforms: Evidence from U.S. Police Departments","Ornaghi, Arianna, “Civil Service Reforms: Evidence from U.S. Police Departments,” MIT mimeo, 2019.","2019","Boston",NA,"Ornaghi, Arianna, “Civil Service Reforms: Evidence from U.S. Police Departments,” MIT mimeo,","2019",NA
"Determinants of Marriage, Fertility, and Migration Decisions","Marriage, fertility, and migration behavior have been the subject of extensive research across many academic disciplines. Considerable work has been devoted to investigating why, whether, and when people decide to marry, have children, and change residences, whether particular programs or factors influence these decisions, and how these choices in turn affect other life decisions. This project considers determinants of these outcomes and evaluates the data used in such analyses. To these ends, this project considers the extent to which empirical analyses using the American Community Survey (ACS) marital history and marital status questions yield comparable or divergent results. The researcher considers determinants of marriage decisions, on their own and in conjunction with fertility and migration decisions, and examine the role of various legal changes and natural experiments occurring between 2008 and 2015.

"Organizational Characteristics, the Characteristics of Organizational Institutional Environments and Texas Oil and Gas Venting and Flaring Practices","This research examines oil lease and gas well venting and flaring practices, the characteristics of organizational entities within the oil and gas extraction industry, and the institutional environments of gas wells, oil leases, and oil and gas extraction establishments operating in Texas through the use of multilevel statistical modeling. We utilize economic data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Business Register, and Census of Mining, as well as community demographic characteristics from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey. We combine restricted-use data with publicly available information from the Texas Railroad Commission, Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Report, the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and other neighborhood-level resources.

By identifying the characteristics of the types of establishments and firms disproportionately responsible for venting and flaring extracted natural gas, decision-makers can better target ecologically inefficient operations and reduce the waste and pollution caused by venting and flaring from the oil and gas extraction industry.","The Effects of Organizational, Community, and State Regulatory Characteristics on Texas Oil and Gas Extraction Facility Venting and Flaring Practices","Willyard, Katherine Ann Calle.

"Organizational Characteristics, the Characteristics of Organizational Institutional Environments and Texas Oil and Gas Venting and Flaring Practices","This research examines oil lease and gas well venting and flaring practices, the characteristics of organizational entities within the oil and gas extraction industry, and the institutional environments of gas wells, oil leases, and oil and gas extraction establishments operating in Texas through the use of multilevel statistical modeling. We utilize economic data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Business Register, and Census of Mining, as well as community demographic characteristics from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey. We combine restricted-use data with publicly available information from the Texas Railroad Commission, Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Report, the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and other neighborhood-level resources.

"The Impact of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Benefits on Workers, and Assessing LEHD Successor-Predecessor Linkages with Researcher-Provided Data on Mass Layoffs","This research analyzes the effects of federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits on worker-level outcomes, specifically educational attainment, cumulative earnings (wages), labor force participation, time-to-rehire, and sectoral reallocation (i.e., whether re-trained workers move to firms and industry of higher or lower relative productivity with respect to the firms from which they separated). TAA benefits – typically cash transfers for worker enrollment in (re)training programs – are awarded to workers that successfully demonstrate to the Department of Labor that their firm’s layoffs were caused by import competition with foreign competitors. This project also explores how the effects of TAA may differ from standard effects of unemployment insurance benefits by using workers laid off due to bankruptcy as a control group. Finally, the project assesses the costs and benefits of awarding TAA allowances, and also considers how regions with higher TAA “generosity” may vary in their support for trade measures with respect to lower generosity regions.","The Impact of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Benefits on Workers, and Assessing LEHD Successor-Predecessor Linkages with Researcher-Provided Data on Mass Layoffs","Benjamin Hyman, 2022.

"Wages, Production and Pass-through","This research explores the effect of a change in input price, in particular, the wage cost, on firms’ input ratios, profitability, and pricing strategy. Economic theory predicts that when the wage costs decrease, firms will substitute away from capital to hire more labor. Moreover, depending on the competitiveness of the market, a change in the input price can affect the output price and the profitability of firms. This project will produce empirical estimates of these effects. In particular: How does the change in wage cost affect the capital-labor ratio in production? Do firms benefit (profit) from a reduction in wage cost? Or do profits decrease and wages rise? Do firms respond to the increase or decrease in wages in a symmetrical way? Does the change in wages pass-through to the output prices?","What Do Establishments Do When Wages Increase? Evidence from Minimum Wages in the United States","Yuci Chen, 2019.

"Farms or Factories? Trade, Reallocation, and General Equilibrium Adaptation  to the Global Productivity Impacts of Extreme Weather","This research endeavors to estimate the causal impact of extreme weather on manufacturing productivity in the United States as part of a broader global analysis of the aggregate productivity impact of intensifying temperature extremes. We will use data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures, Census of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database from 1972–2014 to construct a plant-level panel of manufacturing productivity that will be merged with county-level weather data to empirically estimate the causal effect of extreme temperatures. We will combine these results with separate estimates using microdata on manufacturing and agricultural production from many countries around the world to quantify the global heterogeneous impact of extreme temperatures on national comparative advantage between manufacturing and agriculture. These empirical estimates will then be embedded in a model of global trade to understand how the endogenous reallocation of production between broad sectors of the economy could reduce the aggregate costs of the shifting distribution of global temperatures. The trade model will also be used to quantify the degree to which trade barriers impede this mechanism of adaptation.","Climate Change, The Food Problem, and the Challenge of Adaptation through Sectoral Reallocation","Nath, Ishan B., ""Climate Change, The Food Problem, and the Challenge of Adaptation through Sectoral Reallocation"" NBER Working Paper Series, No. 27297, June 2020.","2020","Chicago",NA,"Nath, Ishan B., ""Climate Change, The Food Problem, and the Challenge of Adaptation through Sectoral Reallocation"" NBER Working Paper Series, No.","2020",NA

"Estimating Two-Sided Assignment Models Using LEHD Data","This research employs recently developed methodology for estimating two-sided assignment models for producing forecasts or simulations about a range of labor market phenomena. For such models to generate accurate and useful forecasts, one needs to be able to observe the key characteristics that capture the heterogeneity on both sides of the market that leads certain agents on one side to be disproportionately likely to match with certain agents or units on the opposite side. LEHD data provide a very rich set of characteristics that describe agents or units on both sides of the market (workers and firms). This research will produce forecasts about (i) which workers in which locations would be most affected by alternative forms of local labor demand shocks (plant relocations, stimulus packages, natural disasters), (ii) the degree to which differential access to jobs with strong career paths, differential promotions, and differential frequency and quality of outside offers (conditional on job type) contribute to gender and racial income disparities at different points in the life cycle, (iii) how the earnings distributions by race and gender are likely to evolve in the next decade, given the differences in the racial, gender, and educational attainment composition of entering vs. exiting cohorts in the U.S labor market, and (iv) how assortative matching patterns along various dimensions might change as the occupational and industry composition of the labor demand changes, given the degree to which occupation and industry affect search costs in the marriage market.","How Local Are U.S. Labor Markets?: Using an Assignment Model to Forecast the Geographic and Skill Incidence of Local Labor Demand Shocks","Mansfield, Richard. 2023.

Specifically, we are interested in describing how microeconomic forces shape aggregate outcomes through the dynamic behavior of firms. Recent contributions have shown that macroeconomic outcomes are disproportionately affected by specific categories of firms and/or regions. However, aggregate data masks this rich level of heterogeneity. Thus, we use microdata from the Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database, Standard Statistical Establishment List, and Annual Survey of Manufactures to uncover the heterogeneity in aggregate outcomes at the firm and regional level, and to demonstrate its importance for the aggregate economy. In particular, we will document the extent of heterogeneity across plants and firms, and locations in the U.S. economy along several dimensions, including firm creation and growth, and produce several statistical estimates of the contribution of firm- and location-specific factors to the business cycle, labor market fluctuations, secular trends in market power, and business dynamism.","Outsourcing Dynamism","Andrea Atencio De Leon & Claudia Macaluso & Chen Yeh, 2023.

"Local Economic Shocks and Firm Growth","In this research, we use the detailed geographic information available in the Longitudinal Business Database and the Business Register to trace the impact of local economic shocks and conditions on firm entry and growth. In particular, we exploit house price variation in the period of the Great Recession to examine the sensitivity of entry to a major economic shock, and estimate the subsequent impact on wage and productivity growth (as measured by revenue). We also examine how measures of density and agglomeration impact the firm lifecycle, and what this can tell us about how physical space impacts firm growth. This research is part of our broader agenda unifying the firm lifecycle with the spatial economics literature, which is an under-researched area of firm growth. This can help us understand whether and how space and the distribution of economic activity matters for macroeconomic aggregates, as well as the utility of local initiatives like place-based economic policy.","Firm Creation and Local Growth","Walsh, Conor, Firm Creation and Local Growth (December 1, 2019).

"Wage Changes, Net and Gross Employment Flows","In this research, we study how firm-level worker flows affect the earnings growth that workers experience when they switch from one firm to another. While it is well-documented that earnings grow disproportionately during employer transitions, worker-side survey data are silent on the effect on this growth from shocks on the origin and the destination employers. Using matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, we estimate how the employers' net size changes and turn-over rate affect workers’ earnings in transition. Particularly, we estimate the contribution of job destruction at the origin to lower earnings growth and of job creation at the destination to higher growth. Turn-over also notably affects earnings growth as climbing the job wage-ladder is closely associated with job switches to employers with declining gross hires. We quantify how worker transitions with the flow of employment towards faster-growing employers, contribute more substantially to total earnings growth than simple reallocation.","Pandemic Recession: L- or V-Shaped?","Gregory, Victoria, Guido Menzio, David Wiczer.

"How does the mortgage liability affect career decision? Evidence of cash flow hedging in household financial planning","This research characterizes the two-way spillover effects between the labor and mortgage markets. An understudied facet of home mortgage is its impact on the liquidity profile of the borrowing households. When home equity is low, serving the debt with periodic payments can constitute a real burden to borrowers and may change their risk appetite in the labor market. We document how mortgage debt affects borrowers’ propensity to take riskier jobs, such as working in startups or high-turnover industries, as well as how employment status affects borrowers’ mortgage performance. Using data mainly from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Longitudinal Business Database, and Corelogic deeds, we identify effects utilizing a variety of quasi-exogenous shocks on employment, home equity, and mortgage payments. We expect that mortgage liability discourages borrowers, and especially if the heads of the households are already in debt, from taking a riskier career path and increases the likelihood of staying in a stable job with predictable incomes.","Household Wealth and Entrepreneurial Career Choices: Evidence from Climate Disasters","Cen, Xiao. “Household Wealth and Entrepreneurial Career Choices: Evidence from Climate Disasters” Center for Economic Studies Working Paper 24-39.

"Analyzing the Impact of Firms' Trade Activities on Labor Market Outcomes. A Matched Employee-Employer Perspective","Recent research has attempted to determine the net effects of international trade on the U.S. economy. We aim to determine which types of jobs and industries are most impacted by international trade, and in particular how China’s accession to the World Trade Organization has impacted U.S. earnings and employment among firms that engage with international companies in a variety of ways. By combining data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, Economic Censuses, and the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database, we observe job transitions among workers with skills and firms that are heterogeneous in their susceptible-to-trade shocks. Using a two-sided matching model, we are able to estimate how job matches change in response to these shocks, both directly as a result of foreign competition and indirectly in response to effects on other industries. Results thus generate a comprehensive account of “winners” and “losers” from foreign trade.","The Skill and Spatial Incidence of Changing Patterns of U.S. International Trade among American Workers: Exploring New Pathways Using an Equilibrium Matching Approach","Carballo, Jeronimo and Richard Mansfield (2023): The Skill and Spatial Incidence of Changing Patterns of U.S. International Trade among American Workers: Exploring New Pathways Using an Equilibrium Matching Approach.

"Long Term Effects of Early Exposures Based on County of Birth","This project analyzes the effects of policy and environmental factors on contemporaneous and future schooling patterns. Our outcome variables of interest include a broad set of socioeconomic outcomes; we focus on educational attainment and household income level. Our two aims are to estimate (1) the impacts of five alternative policy/environmental contexts, holding constant each of the other contexts and (2) to explore interactive effects between some of the contexts of interest, where some birth cohorts in some counties could have been exposed to multiple contexts (i.e. both school desegregation and high pollution); in these cases, we will investigate evidence of statistical interaction in the contextual effects. Our focal contexts include school desegregation policies for school ages; exposure to pollutants in utero; hospital desegregation; introduction of welfare programs; and in utero exposure to salt iodization. We will use external, county level data to incorporate these contextual factors for individual in the ACS and Census data. In each case, the ""in utero"" period for each person is operationalized to be the 9-months before the birth date. These benefits cannot be completed with public data because public data do not contain county-of-birth information. Therefore, we are asking for access to restricted data.

Economists and other social scientists have long been interested in the life course impacts of early exposures to environmental and policy conditions. However, it is difficult to empirically uncover causal factors on later socioeconomic attainment. Our proposal contributes to our understanding of early precursors to these attainments by deploying a set of ""natural experiment"" research designs to combine information on exposures based on county of birth.

"The Impact of Local Incentives on Firms' Behaviors","I propose to link Census Bureau data to U.S. public firm financial statements, toxic release data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a database of employment vacancies by Burning Glass Technologies to examine the impact of local incentives on firms’ employment, investment and environmental decisions. Local government decisions to reduce business costs can potentially affect many dimensions of businesses; however, the impact of those decisions is not completely clear. For example, how do local incentives aimed to reduce business costs affect the seasonality of employment and investment? Do they have any impact on firms’ environmental and employment decisions? What kind of characteristics at the establishment and firm level explain the impact? What individual level characteristics are associated with the impact?

"A Polygon-Based Approach to Spatial Network Allocation:  Optimal Facility Location Modeling and Network Analysis","In network-centric research, population is represented by large, aggregated census geographies to reduce computational complexity and accommodate data availability. However, it is well known in the literature that as spatial data are aggregated and precise locational information is lost, error occurs. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel method, PolyPop2Net or PP2N (Population Polygons to Networks), for allocating populations to networks by utilizing restricted-use 2010 Decennial Census microdata and the restricted-use Master Address File Extract as the benchmark truth. We will use publicly available 2010 decennial data to run Operations Research and Network Analysis models to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the PP2N. Specifically, we test the PP2N method using nested Census Bureau geographies from the publicly available 2010 Decennial Census for Leon County, Florida. We use the simulated examples along with the true Leon County examples to determine the generalizability of the new method. The new method will then be shared with others and will be available for use through integration into a spatial analysis package in Python.","Validating Abstract Representations of Spatial Population Data while considering Disclosure Avoidance","Gaboardi, James. 2020.

"R&D, Intellectual Property and Innovation Revisited","Innovation is one of the most important factors driving U.S. economic growth. While a large literature uses patents to measure innovation outcomes, relatively few studies consider the decision to patent, or how that decision interacts with other dimensions of business strategy, including R&D investment. Overall, the purpose of this study is to investigate the link between innovation, intellectual property, and firm economic conditions. This research will use data from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey, along with a newly created firm-level link between the Standard Statistical Establishment List, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s data on issued patents, to study the links between innovation and intellectual property. The first part of this project is to understand the interaction between R&D investment decisions and the strategies used by firms to protect intellectual property. This initial descriptive study will be followed by two sets of analyses that will specifically focus on the main economic forces shaping firms’ decisions in innovation. First, we will examine the role of the risks connected with patent litigation in shaping the incentive to patent and innovate. Second, we will examine the role of large credit shocks and how they shape investment in R&D across different dimensions.

"The Geography of Worker Adaptation: Industry, Skills, Retraining, Mobility, and Housing Costs","The project is a comprehensive new study of worker adaptation to changing labor market conditions, following a nationally representative sample of several million workers who have lost jobs due to involuntary layoffs. We will utilize rich confidential U.S. Census Bureau micro
data from multiple sources - administrative records, censuses and surveys - that will enable us to follow the subsequent economic and geographic mobility of these workers over extended time periods. Using these data, we will provide a portrait of worker adaptation to the ongoing significant changes in demand for labor across numerous dimensions, such as worker history including industry and earnings; and worker and household characteristics including age, education, homeownership, and race. Our primary contribution will be a focus on geography, specifically how place shapes outcomes for individual workers. Observing the multidimensional patterns of worker adjustment, including mobility outcomes and transition to joblessness, will be highly relevant for understanding worker adjustment to mass layoffs and changing economic circumstances. We will follow individual displaced workers over time as well as across states, link their decisions to individual and local characteristics, and include a wide set of metropolitan-level characteristicsthat could shape worker outcomes, including housing costs, employment growth by industry, and other measures of labor market conditions. We will further work towards estimating a set of causal models examining worker mobility choices and long run earnings outcomes to increase our understanding of how involuntarily laid-off workers adapt in a variety of settings characterized by location and industry.","Labor Market Dynamics and Worker Experiences - The Geography of Worker Adaptation to Unanticipated Job Losses","Horn, Keren, Henry Pollakowski, Jeffrey Zabel, and Joseph Chance.

"Input Sourcing and Supplier Choice in International Trade","We study how U.S. importers select their foreign input suppliers and, in particular, how this choice is affected by risk. To this end, we use data from the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, and the Census of Manufactures. First, we document the distribution of the number of foreign suppliers within narrowly defined products to show that top importers typically source their products from multiple suppliers. Next, we explore whether this pattern of supplier diversification can be linked to different sources of risk, including the uncertainty stemming from the supplier’s location and contractual problems that may lead to hold-up. We plan to build a theoretical model of supplier choice under uncertainty and estimate it with the microdata. We will then study how counterfactual shocks, such as an increase in uncertainty in a source country, can affect aggregate trade flows and the overall volatility of the U.S. economy.","U.S. Market Concentration and Import Competition","Amiti, Mary & Heise, Sebastian, 2023.

"Place and Cohort of Birth, Program Availability, and the Measurement of Labor Market Outcomes","This research estimates the long run impact of childhood age, education, and nutrition exposure on adulthood labor market and related outcomes. We measure childhood exposure based upon variation in program or institution availability within an individual’s county of birth. In particular, we consider ages 0 to 5 exposure to the rollout of Food Stamps, Head Start, and their interaction, ages 1 to 17 exposure to college openings, as well as childhood age and exposure to other nutrition and education programs and institutions. County of birth is identified using the restricted-use versions of demographic surveys linked to the Numident File, which contains a place of birth variable. Surveys considered include the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. These surveys enable us to measure the effects of program and institution exposure on a wide array of outcomes including educational attainment, employment status, earnings as well as health, migration, adulthood program participation, and mortality. These estimates extend existing research that documents the short-run impacts of these programs and institutions by demonstrating the long-run impacts of these programs and institutions. Estimates of long-run impacts are necessary for understanding the full societal benefits of these large and costly programs and institutions.","What’s in the Water?

"The Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions on Firm-Specific Wage Premiums","When evaluating mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission focus entirely on consumer welfare. Efficiency gains through consolidation help consumers by decreasing prices, but anti-competitive behavior in the product market hurts consumers by increasing prices. While generally ignored, the same efficiency and competition concerns are relevant for labor markets. If M&A increases efficiency, wages may rise if the gains from efficiency are shared with workers. If M&A increases consolidation in the labor market, wages may fall due to decreased bargaining power for workers. This research uses data from the Longitudinal-Employer Household Dynamics program combined with a dataset of M&A from Thomson Reuters to document the impact of M&A on workers. In particular, we will document how the effect of M&A on wages differs by the level of concentration in the labor market in order to disentangle anti-competitive effects from efficiency effects.","Mergers and Acquisitions, Local Labor Market Concentration and Worker Outcomes","Arnold, David. 2024.

"The Geography of Industrial Reallocation","Over the course of the 20th century and continuing today, U.S. regions have experienced massive shifts to the geographic distribution of economic activity. In this research, we will seek to answer the following three questions: (1) How can we better catalogue these changes in the location of economic activity and industrial networks over the past half-century? (2) To what extent have changes in transportation costs, productivity spillovers, production networks, or exposure to international trade contributed to this reallocation and to regional divergence?

"How Do U.S. Firms Adjust to Chinese Import Competition?","China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 has led to a surge in U.S. imports from China and a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in industries affected by Chinese import competition. While the implications of this “China Shock” for the U.S. manufacturing sector are well documented, little is known about how U.S. firms—the entities that own plants and employ workers—adjust to the China Shock. Do firms reallocate resources away from affected plants and toward plants in less affected industries? Or do they shift resources towards affected plants, allowing them to compete more effectively against Chinese imports? And what explains the direction and magnitude of the resource reallocation? This research will address these questions by using establishment-level microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, and Annual Survey of Manufactures, and worker-level data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program.","Propagation and Amplification of Local Productivity Spillovers","Giroud, Xavier, Simone Lenzu, Quinn Maingi, Holger M.

"Offshoring and Innovation: How Large are the Benefits of Co-Location?","This project has three related parts, each of which is designed to understand the implications of the growing geographic separation of R&D and production for US firms. There are two competing views on this. One view is that offshoring increases US innovation by allowing domestic firms to specialize in what they do best. By shedding activities that can be performed at lower cost offshore US firms become more competitive and have a stronger incentive to engage in R&D (specialization view). A more recent view is that the separation of R&D and production involved in offshoring limits learning-by-doing production insights from reaching the firms’ headquarters and so slows down U.S. innovation: as the country loses manufacturing it also loses its innovation capabilities (hence, called capabilities view). By tackling this question directly our project will inform the Census Bureau on whether its current approach for tracking U.S. innovation should be changed to ensure that it fully captures the various ways in which US firms innovate.
The project will assess the empirical support for the view that firms benefit from the geographic specialization of production and non-production, versus the view that co-location is instead preferable. The central question is: to what extent do firms benefit from co-locating technology creation (such as R&D labs) and production activities in close geographic proximity, either domestically and/or abroad? While interest in understanding the forces underlying the agglomeration (and co-agglomeration) of industries goes back at least to Marshall (1890), with Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010) a major recent contribution to the co-agglomeration literature, the importance of geographic proximity between production and R&D labs for innovation is to date largely unknown.","Colocation of Production and Innovation:Evidence from the United States","Fort, Teresa C., Wolfgang Keller, Peter K.

"The Impact of Credit Access on Entrepreneurship, Income Inequality, and Subsequent Financial Distress","What is the relationship between consumer and firm credit, earnings, and entrepreneurship? In particular, this project aims to uncover the impact of consumer and firm credit on occupational choices (i.e. 'formal' unemployment-insured jobs vs. 'informal' self-employed jobs vs. starting an employer business), the rate at which individuals (either entrepreneurs or wage earners) transition between income and earnings deciles, and the subsequent feedback of income changes to financial distress. In this project we lay out 4 testable hypotheses, as well as multiple identification strategies for each hypothesis.
The general theme of these hypotheses is that households have gained significant amounts of access to credit (defined as the available borrowing limit across all types of credit) over the past 40 years and we want to uncover how this run-up in credit has impacted the real economy. In addition, small firms have gained access to credit through banking reform as has been recently studied by Bai et al. (2016a). The first two hypotheses are aimed at understanding how access to credit has affected individuals' ability to start businesses, the types of employees they hire, innovation, and subsequent earnings inequality. Our identification strategies rely on a mix of IV-estimators and other natural experiments. We also plan to provide several important descriptive statistics, including income and earnings transition matrices for individuals and entrepreneurs as a function of their access to credit as well as other characteristics. 
The third portion of the project is to understand the feedback from income changes to credit access and financial distress to firm outcomes such as purchase of entrepreneurial firms and going public through initial public offerings. We plan to study the relationship between income volatility, firm earnings volatility and access to credit. In particular, how does the level and variability of income affect an individual's ability to obtain a mortgage? What is the impact of income variability and credit access of firms on financial distress for self-employed and working individuals? Simple OLS analyses will go a long way toward understanding these relationships, but we also provide some more sophisticated identification strategies to uncover these relationships. 
The fourth part of the project is to understand worker choice of type of firm to work for.  A major policy issue has been a big drop in entrepreneurship in the US over a long period. Researchers have focused on the actual entrepreneurs - their financing, demographics affecting the supply of potential entrepreneurs, exit options.  Our focus is on the workers choosing between entrepreneurial firms and other firms.","Production and Learning in Teams","Herkenhoff, Kyle, Jeremy Lise, Guido Menzio, and Gordon M.

We use data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to construct fine-grained, highly populated frequency histograms that allow us to estimate a multicomponent statistical model of the income distribution, which better capture the three generative processes that prior researchers have speculated shape the income distribution. Findings will identify the crucial characteristics of each of these processes and inform empirically-based theorizations of different modalities of income appropriation. This will ultimately cast light on the occurrence and consequences of unemployment or partial engagement with labor markets, segmentation and stratification in labor markets, and the relationship between functional and individual income.","Labor Market Segmentation and the Distribution of Income: New Evidence from Internal Census Bureau Data","Scharfenaker, Ellis, and Markus P.A.

"Recessions, Local Labor Markets, and Inequality","Growing evidence suggests that recessions catalyze lasting changes in the U.S. economy. For example, every recession since 1973 has led to a persistent decrease in earnings per capita in counties where the recession was more severe (Greenstone and Looney, 2010; Stuart, 2017). The overall consequence of this finding depends on why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity. Local economic activity could decline because high-income individuals are more likely to migrate away from places experiencing negative economic shocks (Bound and Holzer, 2000; Notowidigdo, 2013), or because employers change their production process (Jaimovich and Siu, 2015; Hershbein and Kahn, 2017) or shut down (Foster, Grim, and Haltiwanger, 2016). Although a large literature documents the consequences of recessions, there is relatively little evidence that specifically examines why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity.
This project will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by enhancing the measurement of local economic activity and providing new evidence on the effects of recessions on workers, employers, and local labor markets.","Comparing Mean Earnings and Earnings Percentiles for Local Labor Markets using the LEHD","Christopher Goetz & Brad Hershbein & Bryan A.

"Small Businesses and Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance","Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the backbone of coverage and health care in the United States. Yet, there has been a substantial decline in employers offering health insurance, especially among small businesses, over the past 20 years. These small businesses occupy an especially important position in the employment of racial/ethnic minorities, and thus lower rates of ESI provision for small businesses may help explain the lower rates of health coverage among disadvantaged groups. However, not all small businesses fail to provide ESI, and researchers have failed to examine the potential impacts of business owner and community demographics, which may play an important role in explaining ESI coverage. By combining data from the Survey of Business Owners, Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, and Annual Business Survey, we are able to examine ESI provision among small businesses by employer race/ethnicity, employer nativity, and the race/ethnic composition of the surrounding geographic area.","Minority- and immigrant-owned small businesses and employer-sponsored health insurance","Tran, Melanie K.

From these linked data, we hope to produce new, unbiased estimates of the economic impact of new energy development investments on local economies, for different types of industries.","Regional employment and earnings impacts of wind development: Evidence from nearly everyone in 23 states","Gagarin, Hannah, Benjamin Gilbert, and Benjamin Hoen. 2023.

"Shareholder-Creditor Conflicts, Financial Distress, and the Real Economy","A central tenet of U.S. corporate governance is that management should maximize shareholder value. However, as is now well-understood, shareholder maximization may impose costs on other stakeholders, including creditors and employees, that may not be internalized by shareholders. While there is recent evidence that the conflicts between shareholders and creditors—and even conflicts of interest among different classes of creditors—can have large impacts on corporate policies, there exists limited research analyzing precisely how these conflicts influence resource (mis)allocation in the economy. The purpose of this research is to conduct a micro-level analysis that documents how creditor control and borrower-lender relationships influence the investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions, as well as employees of borrowing firms in (or in close proximity to) financial distress. The Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Quarterly Financial Report, Auxiliary Establishment Survey, and Standard Statistical Establishment List will be used to quantify the effect of credit markets on individual firm behavior and performance, as well as worker earnings. We examine the influence of these conflicts on real activity and employees using two financial distress events that afford creditors greater control over corporate decision-making: bankruptcy and covenant violations (“technical default”). We complement these “ex post” analyses of creditor control with an “ex ante” analysis of The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act—a major piece of legislation that strengthened shareholders’ rights relative to creditors.","Can Strong Creditors  Inhibit Entrepreneurial Activity?","Nuri Ersahin, Rustom Irani, Katherine Waldock, 2021.

"The New York State Homestead Tax Option: Tax Incidence and Equity","In this research, we estimate how a local property tax increase affects rental housing cost and maintenance quality. We construct a unit-level panel from the American Housing Survey from 1974 to 2005 to exploit within-city variation caused by the adoption of a unique tax law in several municipalities in New York State. In 1981, New York State created the Homestead Tax Option (HTO), which allowed local governments that adopted the law to charge rental complexes with four or more units a higher property tax rate than rental complexes of three or fewer units. To identify the effect of this policy on renters, we use the census-block code available in the restricted-use data to identify if a surveyed unit is located in a city that adopted the HTO. We then utilize the within-city tax rate changes caused by the HTO to estimate, within a difference-in-differences framework, if and to what degree property owners shift the burden of this tax onto renters. This policy-relevant parameter will give insight into the equity of the property tax system in an urban setting and identify how local tax structures, such as the property tax, contribute to increased housing costs.","The Shifting of the Property Tax on Urban Renters: Evidence from New York State’s Homestead Tax Option","Schwegman, David J. and John Yinger, 2020.

"Dynamic Effects of Wage Setting: Evidence from the National War Labor Board","This research will provide the first estimates of the dynamic effects of wage minimums and maximums on wage inequality and employment in the United States. We combine demographic data from the Decennial Censuses of 1950–2000 with data on wage setting minimums and maximums by occupation and geographical area during World War II. We then estimate the impact of wage controls on wage inequality using spatial discontinuity in wage setting across War Labor Board regions and zones. In particular, we compare economically similar proximate towns located in different War Labor Board regions and zones and, thus, subject to different wage regulation during World War II. Using this approach, we will estimate the effect of minimum and maximum wages on wage inequality and employment using the 1950–2000 Decennial Censuses to estimate the dynamic impacts of the regulation after it was rescinded. In doing so, this project sheds light on the causes of the decline in inequality experienced in the post-war period and contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the importance of institutions for inequality.","The Effects of the National War Labor Board on Labor Income Inequality","Vickers, Chris and Nicolas L.

"Firm Organization Across Space","This project will use micro data to document firms’ organization of activities across space, and to assess how differences in firms’ geography and international trade activity affect their performance and innovation. A key element in the project is understanding firms’ decisions to own multiple establishments across different locations and industries. We will link detailed input usage data and product line information from the Census of Manufactures (CMF) and the Census of Retail Trade (CRT) to the international trade transactions databases. We will use these rich data to assess whether within-firm variation across establishments and international trade data can be used to impute missing data at the establishment level. We will also assess the extent to which the specific inputs or products that are pre-listed on the various economic census forms can be updated both to gather more relevant information and to reduce respondent burden. This project will also assess the extent to which various decisions, such as technology upgrading, take place at the establishment versus firm level. We will combine technology information from various surveys to document whether use of different technologies, such as electronic networks, are made at the establishment or firm level. By comparing technology responses across surveys, we can shed light on the accuracy of individual surveys. Most importantly, assessing the extent of heterogeneity within a firm and across establishments will provide the Census Bureau with valuable information on whether future technology surveys need to be conducted at the firm versus establishment level.","Cleaning the Census of Retail Trade Product Lines Data","Smith, Dominic.

"Managerial Incentives in the Asset Management Industry","This research proposes to study managerial incentives in the mutual fund industry by primarily investigating two questions: First, does the labor market for mutual fund managers discipline poorly performing managers? Second, how is managerial compensation determined? 
To answer these questions, the researchers will request a number of internal databases, most notably Longitudinal Employer-Household Database (LEHD), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and Compustat-SSEL Bridge files; and for external databases, Morningstar, LexisNexis Public Records, MFLinks, CRSP, and Thompson Reuters. The researchers either have subscription or membership for all external databases. All of the internal databases are requested for the years between 1990 and the latest year available, with the exception of LBD used to more accurately pin down firm age.  
The research will benefit the Census as the researchers plan to conduct a systematic assessment of the firm age variable by statistically comparing the Morningstar data with relevant data from various US Census programs. Morningstar provides a unique and an accurate way of calculating firm age for these mutual fund companies, which involves using a combination of advanced textual analysis to extract mutual funds' prospectus and tracking using a variety of different methods the inception dates of each fund affiliated with a mutual fund company. This comparison will shed light on the current methodology employed by Census to calculate its firm age variable in the LBD, i.e., firm age is counted as the age of the oldest establishment.","Are Mutual Fund Managers Paid for Performance?

"Factors associated with internal and international migration at the block group level","In this research, we estimate factors associated with internal and international migration flows to the United States, taking advantage of restricted-use data on current residence at the block-group level and previous residence at the county level. The analyses use a historical perspective, investigating data from Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys between 1950 and 2016. Individual characteristics in the models include individual characteristics, as well as distance between counties and population size, which is consistent with gravity models and the regional equilibrium framework. Treatment of spatial dependence, by measuring the influence of neighboring areas at origin and destination on the likelihood of migrating, is also employed.","Social Dynamics of Geographic Mobility","Yen, Shih-Keng. 2022.

"Displacement, Neighborhood Change, and Residential Migration Patterns:  Causes and Consequences","The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of race/ethnicity, household characteristics and environment, and census tract, county, and state-level social and economic characteristics on voluntary and involuntary migration. The project will also produce estimates of the total U.S. population, stratified by race and ethnicity, that migrates over various distances and provide an analysis of the factors influencing this migration. In attempting to explain the rise of intrastate migration and reduced rate of interstate migration, researchers have highlighted the importance of both economic and non-economic factors. However, many of these factors are theorized to operate at more localized geographical levels than are available in public data. This has led to a dearth of research capable of examining the relative importance of economic and social factors on internal migration among major racial and ethnic groups. To analyze the neighborhood-level dynamics that theoretically drive differences in migration patterns, researchers must be able to identify the neighborhood of residence of individuals and households, as well as the aggregate characteristics of these places. Restricted Census data will be used to examine both inter- and instar-state migration dynamics at an appropriate unit of analysis.","Socioeconomics of Modern-Day Migration Within the United States: Determinants and Economic Implications Across Race and Ethnicity","Dixon, Bryanna H. 2022.

"Social Capital and Entrepreneurship","The central purpose of this research is to examine the influence of social capital on entrepreneurship (in the form of self-employment). Social capital (SK) can be defined as “the societal analogue of physical or economic capital—the value inherent in friendship networks and other associations that individuals and groups can draw upon to achieve private or collective objectives.” Previous literature indicates that community and individual SK is important in determining who becomes an entrepreneur. However, much of the previous analyses used small samples sizes or weak measures of social capital. In this research, we will use the 2000 Decennial Census, the 2000 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and an external data set, the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), to address the following questions: (1) What types of social capital (structural or cognitive) are more important in predicting self-employment, both at the individual and community levels? (2) How important is the role of social capital in the transition between paid employment or unemployment to self-employment? (3) In the transition to self-employment, how does social capital influence an individual to remain in the same occupation or industry? We will also explore how the results vary across rural and urban environments and natives versus immigrants to assess how relationships between social capital and entrepreneurial activity differ across demographic and geographic dimensions.","ESSAYS IN URBAN ECONOMICS","Burns, K.

"Neighborhood Income and Material Hardship in the United States","This research will examine whether the likelihood of reporting material hardships is affected by the relative affluence of one’s neighbors. We analyze this issue using data from the 2008 panel of the restricted-use version of the Survey of Income and Program (SIPP), where we can identify the neighborhood (census tract) of residence. One of the central aims of the proposed research is to provide information about the prevalence of seven different hardships among the population, and, in addition, how these patterns vary by the characteristics of the neighborhood of residence. This kind of neighborhood-level analysis is novel, and thus represents a unique contribution to our understanding of patterns of material hardship among the U.S. population.","Neighborhood Income and Material Hardship in the United States","John Iceland & Claire Kovach, 2022.

"Testing New Constructs in Innovation and Entrepreneurship to Inform Census Data Collection Efforts","Innovation lies at the heart of most entrepreneurial activity, and yet its role in supporting the growth and survival of new and existing rural firms remains poorly understood, largely because suitable data for studying this question have been lacking. A newly available dataset shows that innovative activity, broadly defined, is far more prevalent in rural areas than commonly believed; this dataset for the first time also allows in-depth research to examine the roles of different types of innovation in rural firm success. By combining this nationally representative, novel establishment-level dataset with detailed Census micro data we can test hypotheses about the emergence and viability of rural entrepreneurship that could not be examined previously. In addition, by linking the establishment survey with founders’ information in the Census Survey of Business Owners the research will provide unique insights on female and minority entrepreneurship.  We will use appropriate econometric methods including selection and survival models, quantile regression and two-sample two-stage least squares to address these questions. In addition to devising a new taxonomy of county-level entrepreneurship and presenting more refined measures of innovation, we are able to determine the precise role played by different types of innovation in firm success measured by, among other factors, earnings, survivability and the ability to compete internationally.

Our expected results include identifying detailed and specific policy recommendations and investment strategies for different types of entrepreneurs and under varying county conditions that ultimately may lead to more sustained rural economic growth.","User Entrepreneurship and Firm Employment Growth","Tian, Zheng, Luyi Han, Timothy Wojan, Stephan Goetz and Anil Rupasingha

"Small Area Estimates of Childhood Obesity: A Spatial Multilevel Modeling Approach","This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by investigating the feasibility of producing model-based estimates of county-level and census tract-level childhood obesity rates using data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), and comparing these rates across urban versus rural designations nationally and across the nine U.S. Census divisions. In the process, the research will also benefit the Bureau by demonstrating the utility of the NSCH data for analyzing social conditions related to childhood obesity, which is associated with poorer health in childhood and predicts later obesity in adulthood.  These latter benefits will demonstrate the utility of the NSCH for the production of obesity estimates for American children at varying levels of geography, a task for which the NSCH is specifically designed.  Based on respondent demographic information, the team will utilize a small area estimation approach, harnessing the flexibility of spatially explicit information to provide model-based small area estimates and associated confidence intervals for the outcome of interest.","County-Level Prevalence Estimates of ADHD in Children in the United States","Zgodic, A., A.

"Competition and Economic Growth","The purpose of this project is to investigate the link between economic competition and economic growth. The goal is to empirically analyze the effect of competition on households, firms, and industries. Economists have explored this question theoretically, but all empirical analyses use small non-representative subsets of firms or identifies correlational (and not causal) relationships. A fundamental economic question is whether increased competition between firms in the same industry increases research and development, innovation, the numbers of new firms entering the industry, and the number of employees in the industry. One important measure of competition is industry and region-level concentration. We will use Census microdata to first describe industry and region-level variation in concentration between the 1960s and 2017. We will then identify the causal effect of changes in industry concentration on the economic outcomes of industries, firms, and households using lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice against firms and industries, the entry and exit of firms into local economic areas, and data describing mergers and acquisitions. This project will also provide insight into several additional important questions. For example, if an industry is very concentrated, then do fewer new companies enter the industry? If a local economic area has a small number of competitors within a specific sector, does that negatively affect local economic growth? If two companies within an industry merge, how does that affect their competitors? If an industry suddenly becomes more concentrated, how are different types of employees affected? And how do all of these effects vary by region and industry?","Antitrust Enforcement Increases Economic Activity","Antitrust Enforcement Increases Economic Activity, by Tania Babina, Simcha Barkai, Jessica Jeffers, Ezra Karger, and Ekaterina Volkova.

"Firms and Workers: Volatility and Inequality","Income inequality has increased substantially in the United States over the last 30 years (see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 for a survey). However, whether the dispersion of earnings growth - what is known as income volatility or instability - has also increased and what the nature of this instability is remains the subject of considerable debate. Following the seminal work of Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), several researchers have found that income instability has increased over the past two decades. Recent work using administrative data, however, indicates a declining trend or no trend at all (e.g. Sabelhaus and Song, 2010). Moreover, most of the existing research focuses on worker characteristics, even though firm characteristics and the extent to which workers transition across different employment states and different employers could be equally, if not more important, to explain the evolution the extent and evolution of income instability.
This project proposes to combine employer-employee linked data from the Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics (LEHD) program with other administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as external data to inform the Census Bureau about the evolution and nature of income inequality and income instability. Precise estimation on the evolution of the dispersion of the growth rates of labor income, a measure of income instability, is crucial to measure the degree of uncertainty or risks that workers face, informs our understanding of the evolution of income inequality, and has important economic and policy implications (see Low et al., 2010; Guvenen and Smith, 2014; and the references therein).","Quantifying Racial Disparities Using Consecutive Employment Spells","Isaac Sorkin, July 2023, ""Quantifying Racial Disparities Using Consecutive Employment Spells.""

"The Demographics of Air Conditioning Adoption: Evidence from the American Housing Survey","Previous work has found that access to air conditioning dampens the relationship between heat and mortality, but it has used coarse, noisy measures of air conditioning adoption. We propose to develop annual, county-level measures of air conditioning adoption from the American Housing Survey. We will develop this measure by, first, estimating how air conditioning adoption depends, state by state, on respondents’ demographic characteristics and locations’ average weather and, second, combining these state-level estimates with county-level American Community Survey demographic information to calculate our county-level measure. We will use our new county-measure to improve previous estimates of the benefit of air conditioning, to estimate whether the availability of air conditioning makes weather forecasts more or less important for health outcomes, and to estimate whether the availability of air conditioning makes public health interventions more or less successful at reducing mortality from extreme heat.","Fatal Errors: The Mortality Value of Accurate Weather Forecasts","Shrader, Jeffrey G., Laura Bakkensen, and Derek Lemoine.

"Housing Choice Voucher Program Outcomes","The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the largest tenant-based rental housing subsidy in the nation. Prior research presents mixed evidence regarding the location outcomes for recipient households. This project seeks to identify the types of households, market conditions, and neighborhood composition that are more likely to promote mobility and access to high-opportunity neighborhoods for voucher recipients. It will extend past research on the HCV program to address these questions at a national scale and analyze temporal dynamics (such as conditions pre- and post-voucher receipt), a feature that is absent in the existing literature.
This research will produce new comparative statistics about the static and time-varying representation of voucher and non-voucher households according to neighborhood characteristics. For example, we will examine the characteristics of neighborhoods that see a relatively quick loss of HCV households within a short period of time. Further, this project will simulate outcome projections of the implementation of Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), broadly and based on sociodemographic and market factors. By identifying the proportion of HCV households likely impacted by SAFMRs, and their probable characteristics, this research will offer timely insight into the efficacy of this approach to setting voucher standards. Additionally, this research will yield a variety of estimates describing voucher households and their residential mobility behavior based on recipient, household, housing unit, market, and other locational characteristics.","Subsidy Overlaps in Federal Housing Policy","Colburn, G., Acolin, A. and Walter, R.

This project will benefit the Census by examining the usefulness of the home-work information available in the ACS for understanding the nature and geographic scope of local labor markets, as well as for tracing out the effects of shocks to those markets. To accomplish this, we will use the restricted use ACS to estimate the outcomes of place-based programs that incentivize investment in specific areas and local minimum wage ordinances. We will compare results using restricted-access ACS information on commutes to commuting patterns observed in the public-use LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data. This comparison will shed light on relative advantages and disadvantages of each dataset in measuring commuting patterns overall, as well as for different subpopulations.","Combining Rules and Discretion in Economic Development Policy: Evidence from the California Competes tax Credit","Freedman, M., S.

"Does Firm Corporate Governance Affect Worker Outcomes?","This project analyzes how firm corporate governance affects worker outcomes. Corporate governance can be defined as the institutions within each firm that govern its decision-making, and the resulting balance of power between stakeholder groups. Contemporary trends in corporate governance include increased owner control over executives, the emergence of new styles of ownership to fund and restructure firms, and a large decline in the number of publicly listed firms. We use Census longitudinally-linked data to analyze the relationship between these trends and individual worker and worker household outcomes including earnings, employment, and occupational attainment. We begin our project by using novel network methods to impute occupation into the LEHD. We then describe the relationship between corporate governance and worker outcomes, using variance decomposition, regression, and Markovian modeling. We thirdly estimate the effect of firm governance transitions on worker outcomes, for example private equity buy-outs. Finally, we take a spatial perspective to study how the diversity of firms within local labor markets influences local inequality.","Racial Inequality and Bureaucracy in US Manufacturing","Nelson, Dylan K. and Nathan Wilmers.

"Market Power, Prices, and Productivity","This project aims to study the intersection of productivity growth and market power, in an economy-wide context. We will consider how changes in market power and consumer demand are related to the evolution of prices, productivity, markups, and costs. Our main research questions are: 1. What is the establishment-level productivity and the degree of price dispersion across various sectors and locations in the U.S. economy? 2. How much have markups risen in various sectors of the U.S. economy over the past several decades? 3. Does controlling for changing markups, particularly establishment-level price changes, significantly change the measured productivity growth both at the sector-level and across industries? 
To answer these questions, we will jointly estimate a flexible structural model of consumer demand and the production technology used in each 6-digit NAICS sector, relying on data observed in standard plant-level datasets. Applying these methods to the detailed data from the Census Bureau, we will study how the evolution of productivity and market power has occurred in different industries, geographies, and in aggregate. In particular, we will examine and pay special attention to non-manufacturing sectors as they account for the majority of the economy.","Urban-Biased Growth: A Macroeconomic Analysis","Eckert, Fabian, Sharat Ganapati, and Conor Walsh.

"Causes and Macroeconomic Implications of the Growth of the Professional Business Services","The main contribution of this paper is providing new facts on the growth of Professional Business Services (PBS) sectors and how they contribute to productivity in the economy. Specifically, we aim to (1) determine the role of improvements in IP law on growth of PBS sector, (2) analyze its implications on macroeconomic variables such as productivity, wage dispersion, job-to-job transitions and entrepreneurship and (3) measure how much flexibility is provided by outsourcing different inputs instead of hiring/purchasing them. Firstly, this project will use Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from 1976-2018 to determine whether the growth in PBS sector came from new firms, new locations and new establishments. Secondly, utilizing the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and Service Annual Survey (SAS) for 2017, the relation between importance of secrets for different firms and their use of PBS will be analyzed. Thirdly, using the ASM, SAS, and related Economic Census (EC) surveys for manufacturers and service firms for 2012-2017, paper will try to estimate how purchase of PBS services complement/substitute low and high skill workers present at the firm as well as how it provides firms flexibility through idiosyncratic shocks.","Productivity Gains from Labor Outsourcing: The Role of Trade Secrets","Bostanci, Gorkem. 2022.

"Sources of Increasing Firm Heterogeneity","This project investigates the sources of rising firm heterogeneity in the U.S economy.  We explore three distinctive forces behind this trend: technological change and innovation activities, frictions in the labor and capital input market, and distortions in the output market such as firms' strategic scale, scope, or pricing decisions. Uncovering the importance of these forces has important implications for allocative efficiency, aggregate TFP, and welfare of the economy. We pay specific attention to firms that operate multi-unit establishments, produce multi-products, and/or are active in a large number of geographic markets. In this way, our project refines the existing studies by conducting measurement and analysis over time, across space, and within the firm.","How Costly Are Markups?","Chris Edmond & Virgiliu Midrigan & Daniel Yi Xu, 2023.

"Energy and the Environment - Plant-Level Production and Market-Level Incidence","The extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulations influence firm-level production decisions has important implications for aggregate welfare and distributional incidence. Empirical research in this area is limited though growing. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods still compares how ""clean"" versus ""dirty"" industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, the availability of firm and plant-level data makes it possible to recognize that firms within an industry differ very widely. Even within a narrowly defined industry firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces.

"Energy and the Environment - Plant-Level Production and Market-Level Incidence","The extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulations influence firm-level production decisions has important implications for aggregate welfare and distributional incidence. Empirical research in this area is limited though growing. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods still compares how ""clean"" versus ""dirty"" industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, the availability of firm and plant-level data makes it possible to recognize that firms within an industry differ very widely. Even within a narrowly defined industry firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces. The lack of high-quality, firm or plant level microdata has substantially limited research in this area.","Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Stringent?

"Gentrification in the Context of New Geography","This paper studies gentrification at the block or block group level, using restricted American Community Survey (block group) and Decennial Census (block for 1970-2000, block group for2010) data linked to other block or block group level datasets available publicly. The block-level data will be used to estimate a quantitative general equilibrium new geography model, which will pin down what kind of shocks or ""changes"" are most important in explaining the gentrification patterns we see in cities today, and how large a role heterogeneous agents and/or agglomeration effects play in these patterns. In order to capture the empirically-observed rich spatial variation between small geographic units, using block or block group level data is critical. Moreover, the block-level data can be used to disentangle the competing results of micro- and macro-level studies of gentrification. Micro-level studies typically feature a narrative of displacement whereas macro-level studies find no significant displacement effect. Reconciling these findings by using micro-level data in a macro-level model which can aggregate results will also be an important contribution to the literature.","Implications of Zoning for Urban Gentrification in New York City","Lam, Michelle S. 2023.

"Ownership status, capital structure, and investment","This project will investigate differences in capital structure, investment rates, and rates of return between publicly traded and privately held firms. A long literature in corporate finance has studied the connection between firm ownership, capital structure, and investment. Going public helps firms diversify their funding sources, relaxing financial constraints (Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales 1998). On the other hand, going public increases separation between ownership and control possibly worsening agency problems (Jensen and Meckling 1976). However, evidence on the importance of these mechanisms, and on the net benefits of public ownership, is limited. This is because it is difficult to observe capital structure and investment decisions of private firms. Quantifying the benefits of going public has become a more pressing question in recent years since the number of publicly traded US corporations has declined substantially since the early 2000’s (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz 2017). Our goal in this project is to use data from the Quarterly Financial Report to provide extensive, long-run evidence on average differences in investment and capital structure between private and public firms, on the consequences of going public, and on the contribution of changes in ownership composition to trends in aggregate investment and returns to capital.","QFR code","QFR code","2024","Chicago",NA,"QFR code",NA,NA
"""Fixing"" 1990-2010 Census Geography: Geocoding Restricted Data and Assessing Public Estimates","We propose to address two major limitations of existing Census Bureau data products. First, the restricted-access 1990 and 2000 census microdata lack precise geographic coordinates for the residences of respondents. This limitation prevents Census analysts and others from conducting high-precision spatial analysis and modeling with 1990 and 2000 data. The second major limitation to be addressed is the problem of inconsistencies across time in the summarized geographic units in public census summary data. Where the extents of geographic units change between censuses, it can be impossible to determine how the units' populations have changed. To address this problem, several secondary data providers have produced geographically standardized census data series, which give estimates of population and housing characteristics across multiple census years for a single, fixed set of geographic units. The rapidly growing use of these products is concerning because errors in standardized data are potentially severe, but the real magnitude of errors remains undetermined. 
We would use restricted census microdata to address these issues in three ways. First, we will geocode all 1990 and 2000 census responses as nearly as possible to the standards of the current Master Address File. This will dramatically increase the quality and usefulness of restricted-access census microdata for these years. Second, for every 1990 and 2000 census response, we will identify the 2010 and 2020 census block of residence, enabling the production of high-accuracy geographically standardized time series within restricted environments. Third, we will summarize the accuracy of public sources of geographically standardized census tract data, establishing a foundational guideline on the fitness for use of publicly available standardized data products and demonstrating the relative merits of the different standardization approaches each product uses.","Optimized Spatial Information for 1990, 2000, and 2010 U.S. Census Microdata","Fowler, C.

"The Impact of Trade on Consumption, Earnings, and Inequality in the United States","This project seeks to characterize the impact of trade on consumption, earnings and inequality in the United States. On consumption, we aim to use detailed micro-data to measure which consumers buy imported products or domestic products that use imported intermediate inputs, by building a new bridge between the Census data and product-level consumption data from the Nielsen Company. On earnings, we propose to comprehensively measure the exposure of U.S. workers to various facets of international trade, namely import competition, export opportunities, and the use of imported intermediate inputs using the Census' surveys of firms and customs data. On inequality, we use a model to infer the distributional consequences of trade via consumption and earnings from the empirical patterns observed in the data. The project relies on several Census datasets: SSL and LBD to match external consumption data to firm microdata; Economic Census (for both manufacturing and other sectors), Annual Surveys, and LFTTD to measure firms' exposure to international trade; LEHD to measure worker exposure to trade; and finally CFS, SIRD, and BRDIS to understand the role of geography of sales and innovation in how U.S. consumers benefit from trade.",NA,"Borusyak, Kirill and Xavier Jaravel.

"Credit Shocks, Firm Creation and Aggregate Productivity","We examine the extent to which credit shocks affect firm creation and economic growth using two large shocks to credit: the introduction of bank-branch deregulation laws across US states from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, and the recent financial crisis. Although there is consensus in the literature that a more efficient financial sector allows for a better allocation of resources towards more-productive firms, spurring aggregate productivity and economic growth, most research only considers established firms, ignoring the creation of new firms. We analyze how credit shocks impact entry and exit of firms, as well as the productivity, size, and debt structure of firms that enter, and how such conditions persist over time. We do so by combining the Longitudinal Business Database, which tracks entry and exit for the universe of employer establishments and firms, with the Quarterly Financial Report, which includes balance sheet and income statement information for privately-owned firms, as well as local CRA lending data, Compustat financials, and the Economic Census. Finally, we combine our estimates with standard aggregate productivity decompositions to measure the extent to which these forces, and forces unrelated to credit supply, affect aggregate productivity growth.","The Impact of Lending Shocks Across the Firm Size and Age Distribution","Nuno Paixao and N.

"Inequality at the Top: The Contribution of Elites to Social Stratification","The present study aims to track changes in marital patterns by college and graduate program selectivity across birth cohorts from the 1940s to the 1980s and to measure the extent to which these changes have contributed to trends in household earnings inequality. We propose to assess the quality of and leverage linkages between the National Survey of College Graduates and the Decennial Census and American Community Survey. This new data linkage will allow us to produce novel estimates of marital patterns among college graduates according to their detailed educational histories. First, we will use log-linear models of homogamy to measure the extent to which college graduates have increasingly married spouses from equivalently selective institutions. Second, we will use an inequality decomposition to measure the extent to which these trends have contributed to rising inequality between households. These estimates will shed new light on family formation patterns among elites and on the development of inequality over the last sixty years.","Horizontal Stratification among Graduate and Professional Degrees","Hirschl, Noah. 2023. “Horizontal Stratification among Graduate and Professional Degrees.” Dissertation Chapter in Three Essays on Higher Education and Inequality.

"The Impact of Oil Price Shocks on Labor Reallocation","Using disaggregated data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), Census of Manufactures (CMF), and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) covering 1980-2018, we use a simultaneous equation model to investigate the effect of oil price shocks on labor reallocation for various NAICS coded industries in the United States. In light of recent research, we identify whether the cause of the oil price fluctuations is driven by demand or supply shocks. We expect that more oil dependent industries, such as the auto manufacturing sector, will show higher levels of responsiveness than industries traditionally associated with lower oil use; this change in magnitude, however, should diminish when accounting for supply elasticity and supply or demand driven shocks. While prior research on labor reallocation primarily uses more aggregated data, this masks some of the smaller changes occurring in the labor market. As such, by using data from the Census Bureau we are able to more thoroughly investigate the responsiveness of the labor market by accounting for subindustries based off of NAICS codes and additional characteristics, such as capital intensity, energy intensity, and trade intensity.","Oil News and Labor Reallocation","Hanson, Ryan and Ana María Herrera, Oil News and Labor Reallocation.

"Kids to School and Moms to Work: New York City's Universal Pre-K Expansion and Mother's Employment","Using data from American Community Survey (ACS) from 2010 to 2017, this project examines the impact of New York City's expansion of universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) as of Fall of 2014 on the labor force participation of mothers with a Pre-K-eligible child.  Any child who turns 4 years old in a given year and residing in NYC for the past year is eligible for enrollment in UPK in September of the coming school year.  Comparing these mothers with other mothers whose youngest child is 1, 2 and 3 years old and with mothers living in adjacent counties in New York Metropolitan Area (NMA) to NYC, we estimate the program's impact on their labor force participation. We analyze potential heterogeneity in the effect on different sub-populations, given that the uptake of the program is more likely among socioeconomically-disadvantaged and single-mother households.","Kids to School and Moms to Work: New York City's Universal Pre-K Expansion and Mother's Employment","Timilsina, Laxman. 2023.

"The Lifelong Consequences of Early-life Circumstances","In the last twenty years, a large and growing multidisciplinary body of literature has established that the conditions to which a child is exposed in early life and even in utero have immediate and often lifelong consequences (Almond et al, 2017). Despite the rapid progress of this literature, several major questions about human capital development remain unanswered (Currie & Almond, 2011). Perhaps most importantly: can economic and health interventions mitigate the damages from harmful early-life shocks? This project attempts to answer this question by examining long-term outcomes of children whose families were exposed to one of three early-life shocks in the early- or mid-20th Century. The three shocks affect children's health, healthcare access, and finally the interaction between wealth and environmental hazards. To evaluate their impacts, we will utilize records from the Decennial Censuses, the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the Social Security NUMIDENT database. The Census products provide outcome and control variables, while the Social Security files provide detailed information on date and place of birth, which is used to identify treated individuals. The estimation strategy is a difference-in-differences approach, and the resulting analyses will show when early-life shocks matter most and how they potentially interact.","Ashes to Ashes: The Lifelong Consequences of Early-Life Wildfire Exposure","Neller, Seth and Samuel Arenberg. 2021.

"Population Change in Puerto Rico","Recent economic and weather shocks have highlighted a critical need to understand change in Puerto Rico's population. Our research will investigate the hypothesis that two major events - the economic crisis and the 2017 hurricanes - changed Puerto Rico residents' fertility and migration calculus, while affecting mortality in the short-term as well as over a multiple year period. In particular, we expect that the economic crisis and uncertainty after the 2017 hurricane season suppressed fertility, increased mortality in the short term and possible lowered mortality over a longer period, and increased out-migration.
We have three research aims. First, we will describe period and cohort trends in fertility, mortality and migration between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available. These components of demographic change are important for understanding how the sociodemographic characteristics of the population change, both through direct effects (birth, death, out-migration, in-migration) and indirect effects (changes in the population at risk of birth, death, and migration). Second, we will describe the residential locations of Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico or other U.S. states and territories in each year between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available. Third, we will compare demographic, social, geographic, and economic statuses for out-migrants and comparable non-migrants in Puerto Rico to investigate how residential mobility to the US mainland is associated with mortality, fertility, health, household income, poverty, and residential outcomes.","Exploring Uses of Linked Census Data to Support Research on Demographic Change in Puerto Rico","Elizabeth Fussell & Nora Schwaller & Todd Gardner & Narayan Sastry, 2023.

"Labor Demand Shocks, Local Economic Activity, Employment Restrictions, and Criminal Behavior","Congressional inquiries and Executive Order 13826 have called for improved access to data for research on job opportunities for individuals who interact with the criminal justice system. In order to study the interaction of labor markets and the criminal justice system systematically at the micro-level, researchers need detailed person-level longitudinal data on employment, earnings, and criminal justice interactions. Since sample surveys rarely have sufficient coverage to generate the necessary statistical power to study topics such as labor market outcomes by types of crimes or sanctions, employment prospects of ex-inmates in rural areas, or specific prison occupational programs, research requires the analysis of administrative records as described in this proposal. 
To address these needs, this project will integrate data for individuals on employment history and justice involvement to examine the effect of employment on offending at the individual -level. Specifically, this study will examine the relationships between labor demand shocks, kinship job loss, own job loss, conviction-based employment restrictions, and offending. Labor demand shocks lead to changes in own employment, which could impact offending resulting in employment restrictions for convicted offenders. It is then the employment restrictions that contribute to reoffending because of blocked opportunity to reenter the labor force. In addition, estimates of population characteristics will be produced for justice-involved individuals, a group that is notoriously difficult to reach.
To examine the framework described above, four Census Bureau provided data sets will be linked  with PI provided data. The four sources of Census Bureau data requested in this proposal include the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and the Census Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). CJARS is a new dataset built on administrative records that tracks arrests, charges, convictions, and participation in the correctional population in the United States. It currently holds over 57 million records from 17 million individuals in 14 states. Ongoing data collection will expand the size of this data in coming years. CJARS data will be linked with data from the LEHD program, ACS, and Decennial Census to produce individual-level information on employment, earnings, criminal history, and family structure. The PI supplied data will include publicly available LAUS data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and PI-collected legislative data.","Negligent Hiring: Recidivism and Employment with a Criminal Record","Pyle, Benjamin. 2022.

"Evaluating the Utility of SIPP Data to Examine the Increasingly Heterogeneous Foreign Born Population","Social science research is intently focused on describing the characteristics of the increasingly diverse foreign-born population with respect to migrant status, and, if and how integration outcomes vary across status groups. However, empirical studies of immigrant integration have been hampered by a lack of nationally representative survey data of the foreign-born. The research proposed here - specifically focused on health outcomes- aims to address this data and methodological shortcoming and provide avenues for future empirical research on immigrant integration in America. To overcome data limitations, this project first makes three methodological advances by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from the US Census matched to federal administrative records. First, we will estimate the prevalence of measurement error of the foreign-born population in the SIPP by using the existence (or lack) of an administrative record match. Second, we will articulate a method for adjusting sample weights for coverage error in the SIPP that disproportionately impacts estimates of the foreign-born population. Third, we will test methods for using SIPP data in combination with other national surveys in order to impute characteristics of immigrants measured only in the SIPP in much larger surveys that lack such characteristics. The resulting methodological advances and data will be used to examine how health outcomes that are commonly used as indicators of immigrant integration (self-rated health (SRH), number of sick days during the previous 12 months, work disabling illnesses, indicators of psychological distress, health insurance coverage, and routine care) vary by migrant status. Together, the results will present vital methodological and substantive contributions to the growing migrant status literature in the social sciences and health fields. Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to provide a methodological foundation to support empirically-validated, important social and public policy analyses focused on migrant status as well as immigrant integration processes and wellbeing.","Measuring the Effect of Immigrant Legal Status on Socioeconomic Outcomes: Variation by Legal Status Assignment Approach","Spence, Cody. 2021.

Utilizing the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey, the Longitudinal Business Database and the Annual Survey of Manufactures, I will examine how disclosure changes affect firms' incentives to innovate. I will employ trans-log and difference-in-differences methodologies to estimate pre- and post-levels of R&D-related investments and outcomes (i.e. patent count and patent citations). First, it is hypothesized there is a differential effect on a firm's willingness to invest in innovation (i.e. log of R&D related expenditures) modulated by the firm's size (i.e. log of sales) between the pre- and post-periods. Furthermore, it is hypothesized the coefficient on the logarithm of sales is negative--the rationale for this is that larger firms will increase their reliance on smaller firms due to the former's ability to technologically ""leap-frog"" smaller rivals in the innovation process. Lastly, it is hypothesized that smaller, innovative firms (proxied by number of patents and citations) will experience an increase in their propensities to merge with larger, older firms since smaller firms are unable to devote the same resources as their larger and older rivals in subsequent patent races.","Property Rights, Firm Size, and Innovation: Evidence from the America Invents Act","James Driver.

"Measuring Income Segregation with Precise Income Data","This research will measure levels and distributions of income segregation in the U.S. from 1980 to 2010. Restricted-use Decennial Census data and American Community Survey (ACS) microdata will be used to a) derive estimates of income segregation based on actual income numbers (and less top-coding) than the categorical income data available in Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and published tabulations; and b) make use of finer geographical detail than public versions of these datasets provide. Using household-level data to model changes in metropolitan area income segregation as a function of structural and sociodemographic characteristics will allow the estimation of tract-level income segregation without being forced to make assumptions about how tract-level income distributions. Structural characteristics of interest include mean income, and education levels. Supplementary analyses will evaluate how income segregation estimates based on exact incomes differ from estimates based on the categorical public Census data. The researchers will also evaluate how sampling variation affects income segregation estimates.","Lorenz Interpolation: A Method for Estimating Income Inequality from Grouped Income Data","Carr, Andrew (2022).

"Real Estate Pass-through and Household Location Choices","The affordability and accessibility of housing has generated renewed interest following sustained increases in house prices in the largest American cities. While local governments have responded through various policies, understanding of housing and labor markets at a localized level is still relatively superficial. This project will develop a rich understanding of many aspects of local housing and labor markets. Using data available through the Census RDC--in particular the LEHD--this project proposes to understand (1) how households decide where to live within a city (e.g. proximity to employers, other location-based amenities, physical characteristics of housing, and price) and (2) how real estate stock passes through different geographies and demographic groups (i.e. the ripple effects of new development via the chains of vacancies created as households move). Because household and firm location choices may influence access to employment (including entrepreneurial entry and self-employment opportunities), this project will also produce population estimates that allow for understanding the labor market at a very localized level.","Quantifying the Welfare Effects of Gentrification on Incumbent Low-Income Renters","French, Robert, Ashvin Gandhi, and Valentine Gilbert. 2023.

Empirically, we expect to find that, controlling for confounders, there is a negative correlation between a firm investment in basic research and the predicted demand for its new products. Also, we expect the data to validate our novel endogenous growth model that implies that downturns are followed by rapid technological innovation.

"Persistence of Place-Based Policies","Federal and state governments create place-based policies to reduce the concentration of poverty and to improve the status of high poverty neighborhoods. Some evidence suggests that these policies improve the economic status of the targeted neighborhoods relative to similar poor neighborhoods, whether these gains persist once the programs are removed remains an open question. This project examines the funding expiration of Renewal Communities in 2009 and the effect of this termination on residents and workers in Renewal Communities on outcomes such as wages, employment, hours worked, industry employed, family income, public assistance income, and housing values. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design where Renewal Communities are the treatment group and Empowerment Zones are the comparison group, we study this question using restricted 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census and the 2001-2017 American Community Survey (ACS). The restricted data allow us to identify census tracts where individuals live and/or work in, as the placed-based policies are determined at the census tract level. Understanding the lasting impact of place-based policies once they expire is important for policy makers to know whether these programs temporarily or permanently lift communities out of poverty.","Three Essays in Regional Taxation","Dissertation, Kenneth Tester, August 2021, Three Essays in Regional Taxation Chapter 4: Do Place-Based Policies Lead to Lasting Renewal?

"Flood Risk, Migration, and Policy: Evidence from U.S. Households","Floods trigger monumental losses across the US that are projected to increase with climate change. With the recent history of unprecedented flood losses from events including Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey, growing concern surrounds the detrimental consequences for some of the nation's most vulnerable communities. These distributional concerns are not new. Critically, little is known about how households may heterogeneously adjust to flood risk along several key housing margins including location choice and the decision to rent versus own, as well as how these decisions may be impacted by public welfare programs. The project will provide insight into these flooding issues through two empirical papers carefully motivated by theory. Both papers use data from the American Community Survey (2000-2023, as available).  Paper 1 applies a residential sorting model to data on recent movers in major metropolitan areas within the US to analyze the extent to which homebuyers and renters heterogeneously sort across flood risk based on their race/ethnicity, income, and educational attainment. These results will then be used to estimate the impacts of the National Flood Insurance Program and changes in flood risk on intra-US migration decisions and the resulting distribution of socioeconomic groups across flood risk in the US. Paper 2 examines how serious flood events affect migration decisions (e.g. whether, and where, to move within the US, and whether to rent versus buy) and mortgage impacts, and if participation in social insurance programs modifies the responses to flood-related natural disasters. These decisions can have long-term implications for risk exposure and wealth accumulation.","A Dynamic Approach to Explain Flood Risk Exposures and Household Choice","Bakkensen, L.

"Understanding Factors Affecting the Ability of Older Workers to Participate in the Labor Force: Employer Concentration and Employer Demand","Longer lives, the shift to defined contribution (DC) plans, and lower Social Security replacement rates mean Americans need to work longer to secure an adequate retirement. This project analyzes the ability of older workers to find employment in an environment where longer careers are likely to be necessary but where increasing firm concentration and a lack of demand from employers threaten their ability to do so. First, the project examines the relationship between employer concentration and labor force participation (LFP) for workers at various ages. To establish the mechanisms involved in this association, the project will test for heterogeneity in the correlation of concentration and LFP by two dimensions: education and unionization.  In both cases, the effect of concentration is expected to be smaller for workers with more bargaining power, such as the more educated and the unionized. Second, the project explores whether older workers are good for firms' productivity and profitability. The project will estimate the firm-level correlation of the share of workers over age 55 and the productivity of the firm, as measured by revenue per worker, the ratio of revenue to wages, and for the manufacturing sector total factor productivity and whether production targets were met.

"Understanding Factors Affecting the Ability of Older Workers to Participate in the Labor Force: Employer Concentration and Employer Demand","Longer lives, the shift to defined contribution (DC) plans, and lower Social Security replacement rates mean Americans need to work longer to secure an adequate retirement. This project analyzes the ability of older workers to find employment in an environment where longer careers are likely to be necessary but where increasing firm concentration and a lack of demand from employers threaten their ability to do so. First, the project examines the relationship between employer concentration and labor force participation (LFP) for workers at various ages. To establish the mechanisms involved in this association, the project will test for heterogeneity in the correlation of concentration and LFP by two dimensions: education and unionization.  In both cases, the effect of concentration is expected to be smaller for workers with more bargaining power, such as the more educated and the unionized. Second, the project explores whether older workers are good for firms' productivity and profitability. The project will estimate the firm-level correlation of the share of workers over age 55 and the productivity of the firm, as measured by revenue per worker, the ratio of revenue to wages, and for the manufacturing sector total factor productivity and whether production targets were met.

"Wages, Worker Productivity, and Imperfect Competition in the U.S. Labor Market","Recently, there has been considerable interest in how closely workers' pay is tied to their productivity. One motivation for this discussion is the fact that median US worker pay growth has been far weaker than the growth of GDP per worker (labor productivity) since the mid-1970s. In
the decades prior to this, productivity and pay growth followed each other quite closely. Research has shown that the competitive model of wage setting is inconsistent with many parts of the labor market, and critical questions remain. How has the relationship between productivity and wages changed over time? Is the imperfect pass-through of productivity to wages driven by monopoly power in the product market, monopsony power in the labor market, adjustment frictions, and/or other factors? What firm and labor market characteristics are associated with firms paying workers close to their productivity?

This project will improve measurement of the relationship between workers' productivity and their pay, and explore heterogeneity in these measures across time, firms, and labor market conditions. The analysis will add to our understanding of why firms can pay workers less than their productivity and what types of firms pay workers closer to their productivity. The main project uses production function estimation techniques to measure the degree of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, and will estimate this measure across a large number of firms over multiple decades. We can estimate the wedge between workers' marginal revenue product and their wage. Then using another input into the production function (e.g. materials), we can separate how much of this wedge is due to monopoly power in the product market vs. monopsony power in the labor market. Under a model of wage posting with monopsony power, this measure directly identifies a time-varying elasticity of labor supply faced by each firm. As a supplement to this new measure of imperfect competition, we also plan on estimating standard rent-sharing elasticities that measure how exogenous shocks to worker productivity pass through to their wages.

While there are existing estimates of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, most of the empirical evidence on this topic is not directly tied to theories of wage setting and/or are focused on very specific occupational labor markets (so lack enough external validity for the general U.S. labor market). We propose to estimate two theoretically motivated measures of imperfect competition across a large number of firms and over time. Both measures estimate how worker productivity changes pass through to their wages. The first relies on production function estimation and is similar to how IO economists measure markups. The second is a rent-sharing method familiar to labor economists. With estimates of both measures for an overlapping set of firms, we can compare the two different measures, analyze heterogeneity across firms and labor markets, and document how these measures have changed over the past 25-40 years.","Unionization, Employer Opposition, and Establishment Closure","""Unionization, Employer Opposition, and Establishment Closure"" working paper by Samuel Young and Sean Wang from 2021 https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsammygyoung.github.io%2Fsyoung_site%2FunionsClosure.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0dmk3z-3ISEuTcXuQqeJ3g","2021","Boston",NA,"""Unionization, Employer Opposition, and Establishment Closure"" working paper by Samuel Young and Sean Wang from","2021",NA

"The Changing Nature of Work: Clarifying the Impacts of Churn, Wages, and Discrimination","Modern labor markets are shaped by a concurrence of several strong secular trends -- a drastic increase in wage inequality since the 1980s, a shifting tenure and job-churn distribution, the decline of manufacturing jobs, and the further integration of women and racial minorities into the traditional labor market. In this project, we employ LEHD and Census demographic surveys to provide a more complete picture of how each of these trends plays into one another. By analyzing the effects of shifting trends in private- and public-sector employment across industries by age, gender, race, education, and occupation, using linked demographic data, we will uncover 1) how compositional changes in the economy effect the changing rate of job churn and tenure, 2) whether between-firm competition for highly qualified workers exacerbates gender and racial inequalities, and 3) how these results vary across the private and public sectors.","Poach or Promote?

"Effects of Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on Education, Income, Employment and Self-Sufficiency","This project will evaluate the impact of changes in Title III rules that affected required standards for limited English proficient students and provided grant allocation on education, income, employment and self-sufficiency. Title III formula grants were established under the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 in an effort to ensure English learners achieve English language proficiency and established state academic standards. By 2007, all states and the District of Columbia had developed English language proficiency standards, assessments, and accountability measures for monitoring progress of limited English proficiency students. This project will exploit the staggered rollout of the program at the state level to determine the effectiveness of these programs on long-term outcomes such as education, income, employment and self-sufficiency. The project aims to link the 2000 long-form records to subsequent American Community Surveys. The 2000 long-form will be used to determine the age, state of residence, and language spoken at home and the linked ACS data will be used to track long-term outcomes. Various methods, such as event studies, linear spline models, and fixed effects models, will be used to compare those were eligible for Title III programs and those who were not because of age and the staggered statewide rollout.","Dissertation (title unknown)","Obadan, Ann. 2023.

"Intergenerational Insurance and Brain Drain in the Great Recession","While recent research has studied the impacts of the Great Recession on the wages and employment of young adults, less is known about how their parents protected them from the economic crash. By linking young adults in the American Community Survey to themselves in the Decennial Census to obtain their parental information, we intend to investigate how the impact of the Great Recession on the earnings, migration, and educational attainment of youth differed based on the socioeconomic status of their parents. We expect to find substantial heterogeneity within young adults, with the children of wealthier parents being more likely to take protective actions such as delaying labor force entry via the pursuit of higher education and leaving areas that were impacted worse by the Great Recession, while the children of disadvantaged parents being less so. These asymmetric responses and the flight of talented youth from areas adversely affected by the Great Recession may in turn be important in explaining the stark differences in post-recession recoveries observed between urban and rural locations in the United States.","Intergenerational Linkages between the American Community Survey and the 2000 Long-From Census","Anstreicher, Garrett. 2022.

By linking young adults in the American Community Survey to themselves in the Decennial Census to obtain their parental information, we intend to investigate how the impact of the Great Recession on the earnings, migration, and educational attainment of youth differed based on the socioeconomic status of their parents. We expect to find substantial heterogeneity within young adults, with the children of wealthier parents being more likely to take protective actions such as delaying labor force entry via the pursuit of higher education and leaving areas that were impacted worse by the Great Recession, while the children of disadvantaged parents being less so. These asymmetric responses and the flight of talented youth from areas adversely affected by the Great Recession may in turn be important in explaining the stark differences in post-recession recoveries observed between urban and rural locations in the United States.","Family Formation and the Great Recession","Anstreicher, Garrett. 2020.

"College Graduate Outcomes: College Major and Selectivity, Earnings, Career Ladders and Labor Demand Shocks","We are interested in studying the labor market outcomes of college graduates. Specifically, we want to focus on how labor market outcomes vary by the selectivity of the college attended and college major (i.e type of college graduate). We will document differences across type of college graduate in the mean, growth and volatility of earnings in early- mid- and late-career. We will also analyze the extent to which outcomes vary geographically or have changed across college graduate cohorts. We will next analyze the sources of heterogenous labor market outcomes including the a worker's employer, the tasks performed on the job and
occupation. We will study the effect of local labor market conditions at time of graduation on a variety of short- and long-term labor market outcomes including earnings, employment, occupation, migration decisions and employer characteristics.

To accomplish this, restricted Census data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, Decennial Census, American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) and the UMETRICS University Research Data (UMT) will be linked together. The specific LEHD data sets being requested in this proposal include: Employer Characteristics Files (ECF), Employment History Files (EHF), Geocoded Address List (GAL), Individual Characteristics Files (ICF), Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and Unit-to-Worker (U2W). Additionally, PI-supplied data will include area-level measures of labor markets, institution-level information on for U.S. post-secondary institutions, occupation-level descriptors and publicly available measures of average earnings by college attended and
college major.","Essays on College Majors and the Labor Market","Martin, Shawn M. 2022. Essays on College Majors and the Labor Market. Ph.D. dissertation. University of Michigan","2022","Michigan",NA,"Martin, Shawn M.","2022",NA

"Workers and International Markets","How do firms' worker characteristics and engagement in international markets affect each other? Aimed at answering this question, our proposed project will leverage a new method developed by the researchers apportioning firm-level exports in the LFTTD to establishments belonging to the firm in the LBD. By further connecting these establishments with their workers in the LEHD, we will obtain a direct mapping between an establishment's exports and its workers. These links will help us understand the nexus between trade and immigration, how engagement in international trade mediates how firms respond to fiscal stimulus, and how exposure to international markets affects wage inequality.","New Measurement of Export Participation in U.S. Manufacturing","Boehm, Christoph E., Aaron Flaaen and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar. 2023.

"Innovation, Concentration, and Growth","This project will use the Economic Censuses (EC), the Business R&D Surveys (SIRD, BRDIS and the ABS), the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD), and the Revenue-Enhanced Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to provide new series that shed light on two questions.   First, what are the sources of innovation?  What is the role of creative destruction, innovation on a firm's own products, and creation of new products?  How important is access to foreign markets for each type of innovation?  Second, what are the effects of top firm concentration on innovation, aggregate growth, and the spatial distribution of economic activity?

This project builds upon the work the researchers completed in their previous Census RDC projects.  In these projects, the researchers tackled two questions.  First, how do we measure the efficiency of resource allocation across firms for a given distribution of underlying firm productivity?  Second, what are the mechanisms behind the changes in the distribution of firm productivity over time?  How much of the growth in firm productivity takes the form of creative destruction, innovation on the firm's own products, and the creation of brand new products?  

In the current proposal, the researchers plan to address two questions.  First, the researchers will address three limitations of the previous census project.  In the previous project, the researchers inferred the contribution of each type of innovation from the distribution of job flows.  The researchers did not directly observe each type of innovation, but rather inferred the frequency of each type of innovation from the distribution of job creation and job destruction.  The researchers also assumed that the size of quality improvements was the same for creative destruction and own innovation.  A third limitation was that the researchers assumed innovations only built on the products owned by domestic firms.  In the proposed research project, the researchers will directly measure the frequency and improvement in quality from each type of innovation based on the business R&D surveys (ABS-BRDIS-SIRD).  In addition, the researchers will measure the contribution of access to foreign markets to innovation by merging the LFTTD with the LBD and EC.

A second objective of this research proposal is to measure the effect of the growing concentration of sales at top firms.  The researchers believe that growing firm concentration could be the consequence of new technologies that enable top firms to expand.  The researchers plan to examine this hypothesis by measuring the following moments.  First, the researchers will decompose the growth of top firms in an industry into the contribution of expansion into new product lines or markets.  Second, the researchers will measure industry productivity growth in sectors where top firm concentration has increased.  Third, the researchers will measure changes in the share of payments to labor in industry sales, and their correlation with the change in the market share of top firms in the sector.  Fourth, the researchers will measure changes in the market share of top national firms in local markets (defined as an MSA or a county), and the extent of local labor productivity growth in each local market.  Finally, the researchers will examine the correlation of job destruction with the change in the market share of top national firms in the sector. 
           	
These statistics will allow the researchers to measure the empirical importance of different mechanisms of innovation, the importance of exports in innovation, and the economic effects of the growing concentration of top firms.","Output Market Power and Spatial Misallocation","Santiago Franco, 2023.

"Assessment of Nonresponse in the NCVS","The proposed project will assess trends in response rates to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the reasons for declining response rates for the period of 1996-2020. The project will give special attention to nonresponse among racial/ethnic minorities, residents of communities with high concentration of immigrants with varied socioeconomic conditions, and (by using data collected after the 2016 NCVS redesign) residents of different citizenship status. Moreover, the project will examine the implications of nonresponse and nonresponse bias for research on criminal victimization and victims' decision to call the police and other entities (e.g., victim service providers and medical professionals) for help. The purpose is to develop ways for reducing nonresponse and develop adjustments (if needed) for any observed nonresponse bias to achieve a better understanding of factors that affect victimization and victim help-seeking behaviors.","Federal-local partnerships on immigration law enforcement: Are the policies effective in reducing violent victimization?","Baumer, E.

"Innovation and Market Concentration","Rates of national product market concentration in the US have increased markedly since the 1980s. The primary goal of this project is to assess whether changes in firm-level innovation behavior can explain this trend. To do so, we will connect data on innovation from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, the Business R&D and Innovation Survey, and the Business R&D Survey, together with detailed production data from other Census databases, particularly the Census of Manufactures (CMF) and Longitudinal Business Database. Using this data, we will measure innovation concentration: the distribution of innovation activity across differently sized firms. Accordingly, we will estimate empirical models that project R&D characteristics on measures of firm size. Using unique innovation information from the BRDIS and product-level sales from the CMF, we will extend our empirical analysis to innovation by type: internal (towards market areas the firm is already active in) and external (towards market areas new to the firm). Finally, motivated by our empirical findings, we will build and estimate a quantitative model of endogenous firm dynamics and employ it to analyze the contribution of different kinds of innovation to changes in market concentration.","Essays on Firms, Innovation, and Growth","Lorenz K.F.

"Estimating the Impact of Labor Market Concentration and Health Care Costs on the Generosity of Health Plan Benefits Offered by Employers","Employee contributions to health plan premiums and less generous forms of health insurance have both increased in prevalence in recent years in the employer-sponsored health insurance market. Given these trends and the related impact to the financial well-being of individuals, this research project seeks to understand potential drivers of less generous forms of health coverage in employer-sponsored health insurance markets. The research objectives of the project are to investigate the effect of 1) labor market concentration and 2) rising health care costs on health plan benefits offered by employers using Census-provided data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance/Employer Component (MEPS-IC), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) for the years 2001-2023, as available. We hypothesize that both higher labor market concentration and higher health care costs lead to less generous health benefit offerings in the employer-sponsored health insurance market.

The key outcome variables for both sets of analyses will be health plan characteristics computed at the establishment level based on MEPS-IC data (e.g., average employee share of health plan premium). Labor market concentration will be measured at the county-industry-year level based on the LBD data. Local health care costs will be measured based on the average plan premium cost at the county-year level using the MEPS-IC data. 

We will estimate the effects of these independent variables on plan benefit characteristics through regression analysis of establishment level data, controlling for establishment and market level covariates, as well as county and industry-year fixed effects. Establishment level covariates will include measures available from MEPS-IC (e.g., total part-time employees) and productivity measures available for a subset of manufacturing firms from the ASM and CMF data. To account for any unobserved market specific time varying factors that may bias our population estimates, we will use the labor market concentration of neighboring counties and state level malpractice payment rates to instrument for labor market concentration and health care costs, respectively.","Market Factors Influencing the Choice and Generosity of Health Insurance Plans Offered to Employees","Mark K.

"Establishment-level life cycles and analysts' forecasts","This project will examine how multi-unit firms' life-cycle stages influence analysts' forecasts. Whereas prior studies focus on the firm-level life cycle, the proposed study will be the first study to focus on the establishment-level life cycle. Specifically, we will investigate whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower for multi-unit firms whose units are in different life-cycle stages than those whose units are in the same life-cycle stage. The expected findings will suggest that the forecasting difficulty of more diversified firms can be attributed to the different life-cycle stages of each establishment. Additionally, for firms whose units are in the same stage, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if all the units are in earlier stages than if all the units are in later stages. Also, for firms whose units are in different stages, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if the units in earlier stages are larger (i.e., generates more revenue) than the units in later stages. To estimate the establishment-level life-cycle stages, we will use the Census data (CMF) at the establishment level. As a comparison, we will also estimate the life-cycle stages using firms' segment classifications in their 10-K filings. For the additional analyses, we will investigate the industry dynamics associated with life-cycle stages.","Establishment-Level Life Cycle and Analysts’ Forecasts","Dai, Xin and Caroline Lee.  2023.

"Firm Dynamics and Monetary Policy","The project seeks to understand how monetary shocks affects different firms' employment differently. Specifically, are younger and smaller firms more responsive to monetary shocks? There is a strand of literature that measures the effect of monetary shocks on the aggregate economic activity including employment. However, little is known about the disproportionate effect of monetary shocks on the employment of different firm groups. This project aims at providing new evidence on the distributional effect of monetary shocks on firm dynamics. It intends to examine heterogeneous responses of firms to monetary shocks and the propagation mechanism of monetary shocks to employment through financial frictions. It is important because the effective usage of monetary tools to promote maximum employment depends on the understanding of monetary transmission to household spending, business investment, production, employment, and inflation in the United States. The main challenge to answer the research question above is the lack of firm-level data with comprehensive coverage and we utilize restricted micro data from the Census Bureau to overcome this challenge.","Monetary Policy, Employment, and Firm Heterogeneity","Yu, Lina.

"Skill Mismatch and the Countercyclicality of the College Quality Premium","Several papers in the economics literature have documented large and persistent effects associated with graduating into a recession. However, comparatively less is known about how these effects vary over college quality. If these negative effects are disproportionately concentrated among individuals graduating from worse schools, then this heterogeneity may have important implications for income inequality and mobility. By using data on college attended and time of graduation in the restricted-use National Surveys of Graduates, we propose to study how the returns to higher-quality colleges vary over the business cycle. We expect that the earnings and employment premia associated with higher college quality increase during economic downturns, with potential drivers of this result including graduates of higher-quality colleges being more able to find jobs that match well with their skills or being more willing to move to better labor markets. These results may have important policy implications and will further our understanding of socioeconomic mobility and inequality in the United States.","Who Scars the Easiest?

"Factors Associated with Establishment Export Performance and the Spatial Dimension of Knowledge Management","This project will assess the value of constructs such as innovation to understand the role of U.S businesses in the international economy and to compare the correspondence between administrative export data and self-reports of export performance.  Preliminary research using the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey--covering all establishments in tradable industries with 5 or more employees in both metro and nonmetro areas--provides suggestive evidence of the importance of innovation, intellectual property, and skilled labor to the ability of firms to successfully penetrate export markets (Wojan 2019).  Linking REIS to the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) may support more definitive analysis of the association between establishment and local area characteristics and export performance if the self-reported and qualitative assessment of exporting success generally comport with observed export activity from administrative data. The LFTTD will also make it possible to track export performance through time to identify business characteristics associated with entering export markets since 2014. Isolating the factors associated with better export performance can inform: 1) government policy with the objective of improving the balance of trade; 2) the value of collecting data on these factors; and 3) the value of administrative data in facilitating export performance analysis while minimizing respondent burden. A critical complement to the export performance research is the analysis of differences in the knowledge management strategies of exporting and non-exporting establishments.

"American Communities Project","This project has four main components.  In one component, newly available linkages between census records in different years will be used to study two dimensions of neighborhood change: changes in relative income levels (such as gentrification and community impoverishment) and in racial/ethnic composition (such as increasing or declining diversity). The general approach using data from 2000 and 2010 is to identify the location of very person enumerated in either decennial census in each year, then analyze the composition of movers and stayers. The same database will also be used to study selective mobility into and out of neighborhoods at the individual level. The second component is to improve the estimation of tract characteristics in a given year within the boundaries of tracts as they were defined in a later year. Confidential census data sets identify people's census tract location based on the tract boundaries at the time of enumeration, but they also provide information that can be used to place them in other boundaries. This project will develop estimates for tract characteristics in 1950-2000 within 2010 tract boundaries, then extend the estimates to 2020 tract boundaries. The third component seeks to improve estimates of segregation of people across census tracts in terms of social characteristics such as education and occupational standing, similar to recent studies of income segregation.  These measures are susceptible to systematic bias associated with sample size and weighting, and the analysis will introduce methods of bias correction in order to evaluate change over time accurately.  The fourth component is small area estimation (SAE) for characteristics of individual census tracts.  We will examine Bayesian SAE models to increase reliability of point estimates of various population characteristics at the census tract scale that are based on sample data. The result will be an improved understanding of issues of sampling variability at the tract scale, methods for improving estimates, and disclosure of alternative estimates for a select set of variables.","The Rise and Durability of Macro-segregation","Carlson, H.

"Socioeconomic Patterns of Micronesian people from the Freely Associated States","This research examines the demographic, economic and social conditions of Micronesians from the Freely Associated States who live in Hawaii. The U.S. federal government signed a Compact of Free Association [COFA] with these Micronesian nations in the 1980s and 1990s which allowed COFA citizens to live and work in the U.S. without a visa. Media accounts discuss a growing stigma against COFA citizens in Hawaii and their unique immigration status reduces their access to important social services. I ask the following questions: 1) how does the immigration status of COFA migrants inform their housing, employment, poverty, and healthcare outcomes and do these outcomes change during times of significant legislative change that affects access to social services and 2) how does the intersection of structural inequalities based on race, class, gender and migration status shape COFA migrant resource access in Hawaii? Using 1990-2020 Decennial Census and American Community Surveys, I conduct logistic regression analyses to isolate the effect of COFA status on poverty, employment and healthcare access and use the multi-group entropy index and index of net difference to examine patterns of segregation in Honolulu County. Findings support that COFA status is associated with more poverty, lower employment, less healthcare, and that these outcomes worsen over time. Additionally, COFA citizens are increasingly segregated in lower-income areas of Honolulu County. This adds to existing literature by analyzing how immigration status beyond the undocumented/citizen binary influences degrees of exclusion which speaks to broader research on how immigration status affects immigrant incorporation.","Bureaucracies of Exclusion: Immigrant Incorporation and Inequality in Hawaiʻi","Nasir, Sabrina. 2023.

"Firms and Economic Geography","This project will use micro data to document differences in establishment productivity and wages across space. A key focus will be to understand how these differences across establishments aggregate to determine regional differences in productivity and wages and how differences in regional productivity have been affected by changes in business dynamism, productivity growth and the geographic expansion of large firms. 

First, we will analyze the spatial differences in measures of business dynamism (such as the firm start up rate and exit rate, job creation and job destruction, and job separation and job finding rates). In previous work, we have documented that the relationship between business dynamism and city size (measured in population) has changed over time (Rubinton, 2020 under Census project 1975). In 1980, there was no relationship between dynamism and city size, while today big cities are much more dynamic than small cities. A key question will be to explore the causes of the changing patterns of business dynamism across space and the implications for productivity growth. 

Second, we will examine whether patterns of geographic convergence in productivity measures at the firm and establishment level have changed. Previous work has documented that income convergence between poor and wealthy regions in the United States has stopped after 1980. We will examine if the same patterns hold when looking at productivity and worker wages and then explore the underlying causes of the convergence patterns we document. Key areas of interest will be to examine the impact of technology diffusion and adoption, business dynamism, innovation and the geographic expansion of large firms on convergence in productivity and wages. 

Third, we will analyze the geography of technology diffusion and adoption. We will approach this question in several different ways. One method will be to look at whether industries are becoming more concentrated in space. We will look at which industry characteristics are important for determining their geographic concentration, such as age of the industry and measures of innovation or technology use. We will also examine technology diffusion more directly by examining whether local characteristics are important for determining whether or not firms adopt new technologies or whether or not they choose to innovate. We will ask how differences in technology diffusion and concentration impact regional differences in productivity and wages.

Fourth, we will examine whether patterns of selection have changed over time and across space and how this will matter for productivity growth. By selection, we mean the correlation between a firm's productivity and the probability that they exit the market. We will examine the factors that affect selection such as changes in congestion forces in frontier and lagging cities. We will then look at the effect of changes in selection for productivity growth and wage growth across space.","The Adoption of Non-Rival Inputs and Firm Scope","Jiang, Xian and Hannah Rubinton. 2024.

"Estimating Commuting Accessibility by Income and Departure Time","The majority of research on job accessibility is limited by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), where a reliance on aggregate data obscures important differences in commuting times that vary at the sub-block level. This is especially true for commutes made using public transit, where walking makes up a substantial portion of commutes. We propose to improve estimates of commuting time and accessibility by worker income and industry, as well as estimating the extent of the MAUP in comparable studies, by using precise origin-destination pairs derived from linked American Community Survey and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. We supplement these data with detailed, external information about transit networks and associated travel times.  Results will yield improved estimates of job accessibility by income, industry, and time of day for the nation as a whole as well as for several different city and county typologies related to transit availability and commuting patterns.","Understanding the Nuances of Accessibility: Spatial and Temporal Resolution, and Neoliberalism","Chestnut, Joseph. 2024.

"Globalization and the Rise of Dispersion in Firm Performance","In the past few decades, U.S. industries have experienced an increase in market concentration and productivity dispersion. The divergence in firm performance raises concerns regarding potential abuse of market and political power by large ``superstar'' firms, emphasizing the importance of understanding its underlying reasons. Recent literature has focused on the potential roles of the changes in the U.S. anti-trust regime and the rise of information technology (IT). This project studies the role of globalization, i.e. whether increased access to foreign output and input markets, concentrated within large firms, has amplified their ex-ante advantages in the U.S. market. We will use Census Bureau restricted data on foreign activity and firm performance to document how dispersion in access to foreign markets has evolved over time; how did increased market access affect domestic market shares and price-cost markups; and whether the differences in market access can explain observed changes in the distribution of productivity, sales and employment, and specifically the reallocation of production to large firms. We will study the mechanisms through which market access translates into domestic market power, such as process innovation, investment in intangible capital and access to cheap or high-quality inputs.","Wage Inequality and the Spatial Expansion of Firms","Benny Kleinman, July 2023, ""Wage Inequality and the Spatial Expansion of Firms"", Manuscript, University of Chicago, https://binyamink.github.io/bennykleinman/bk_JMP.pdf","2023","Chicago",NA,"Benny Kleinman, July","2023",NA

"Immigration Enforcement, Crime, and Community Trust","The United States invests heavily in immigration enforcement, with a focus on deporting immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. Despite the central importance criminal deterrence plays in immigration enforcement, there is little research on the impact of immigration enforcement on the criminal environment in the United States. In our project, we plan to evaluate the effect of changes in immigration enforcement on both crime rates and crime reporting behavior. To measure crime rates and willingness to report crime, we intend to use the National Criminal Victimization Survey (NCVS), a survey that is uniquely able to measure crime reporting behavior conditional on victimization. Our main measure of immigration enforcement will be monthly counts of the number of ICE detainers issued in each county in the United States, measured using supplemental data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRACFed). We will measure immigration enforcement in two ways. First, we will study the rollout of the Secure Communities program between 2008 and 2014, which enhanced cooperation between local and federal law enforcement and subsequently increased the number of detainers and deportations. Second, we will measure the number of individuals detained by immigration agencies in a county-by-year and use an instrumental variables strategy to identify the causal effect of changes in the intensity of immigration enforcement. Moreover, our analysis will test how impacts on victimization and reporting vary according to survey participant demographics or by the types of individuals who are detained (e.g., their country of origin).","Immigration Enforcement and Public Safety","Felipe M.

"Unemployment Insurance Duration, Labor Market Concentration, and Match Quality: Evidence from the Great Recession","Unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in the U.S. are based on state-level labor market conditions. Labor markets in practice, however, are local. Understanding the interaction between local labor market concentration and the generosity of UI benefits therefore helps us learn more about the role of local labor markets in shaping outcomes for unemployed workers. Most of the existing literature on UI extensions finds no effect on the quality of subsequent employment matches. Motivated by the local nature of labor markets, I contribute to this literature by providing the first evidence of how local labor market concentration affects the quality of matches following an unemployment spell. I propose using the Employer Characteristics File, Employment History File, Unit-to-Worker Impute File, Individual Characteristics File, and Individual Characteristics T26 Components file from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau from 2005 to 2015 to study UI benefit extensions during the Great Recession. I will use a differences-in-differences approach that exploits a natural experiment which caused longer eligibility for benefits in some states with otherwise similar labor market conditions as other states. My main approach will estimate how labor market outcomes are affected by the interaction of these exogenous changes in UI benefit duration at the state level and local labor market concentration. I expect to find that the length of nonemployment spells is longer in more concentrated labor markets, and that wages at new jobs are higher in more concentrated markets that have more generous UI benefits.","Unemployment Insurance Duration, Labor Market Concentration, and Match Quality","Wasser, David (2023).

"Social Returns to Education","I will investigate the question: Does a more educated workforce in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)  enhances the effectiveness of R&D spending by companies in that location and lead to improved firm performance.? The answer to this question has very different implications.  If a more educated workforce leads to increased R&D, then locations (cities) may need to attract a more educated workforce by, for example, investing in local universities.  On the other hand, if more R&D leads to a more educated workforce, then locations may need to invest in R&D tax credits or other incentives for companies.

To accomplish this task, an algorithm will be written that will use the establishment's industry code to classify firms as single R&D locations, multiple R&D locations, or un-categorized R&D location. I expect to find that R&D expenditures has a positive relationship to the level of education of the workforce in that location. Furthermore, I expect to find that productivity, stock returns and cash flows of firms located in areas with a more educated workforce perform better because of R&D.","Skilled Immigration, R&D Concentration, and Industry Consolidation","Aggarwal, Rajesh and Mufaddal Baxamusa. 2023.

"Social Returns to Education","I will investigate the question: Does a more educated workforce in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)  enhances the effectiveness of R&D spending by companies in that location and lead to improved firm performance.? The answer to this question has very different implications.  If a more educated workforce leads to increased R&D, then locations (cities) may need to attract a more educated workforce by, for example, investing in local universities.  On the other hand, if more R&D leads to a more educated workforce, then locations may need to invest in R&D tax credits or other incentives for companies.  The major datasets needed for this research are:  Business Research & Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), Longitudinal Business Database,  Census of Manufactures (CMF), Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM).  This project will develop measures of accuracy and possible sources of error in the BRDIS survey. To accomplish this task, an algorithm will be written that will use the establishment's industry code to classify firms as single R&D locations, multiple R&D locations, or un-categorized R&D location.

"How does monopolistic competition across industries affect socio-economic outcomes in the U.S.?","In this project, the researchers will explore whether an increase in market power across industries, as measured by markups at the firm and establishment level has led to an increase in income inequality at the county, MSA, and Census tract level. The research will examine the impact of competitiveness of industries on labor movement across establishments (reallocation, hiring, and firing rates), profits of firms, changes in the patterns of sources of financing and inputs for production, and pollution at the firm and establishment level. Moreover, this project will characterize how the impact on these socio-economic outcomes varies depending on firm-, establishment-, and worker-level characteristics, and will further examine the implications for productivity and economic growth. To measure competition across industries, the researchers will also use other measures such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the number of establishments per square mile, and the number of firms per square mile, among others.","Essays in Private Capital","Mittal, Vrinda. 2023.

"Are environmental markets more efficient?","The central appeal of market-based environmental instruments is cost-effectiveness. Despite strong consensus amongst economists and environmental policy makers, there is limited to no causal evidence that environmental markets are less costly than traditional command-and-control strategies. We develop an empirical test of misallocation of emission abatement using observed data from all U.S. greenhouse gas and air pollution emission markets. Specifically, we compare the variance of average revenue per emission for industries covered by pollution markets to similar industries regulated under command-and-control strategies. Less dispersion of average revenue per emission for facilities in industries covered by air pollution markets serves as an indicator of market efficiency.","Do environmental markets improve allocative efficiency?

"The Effect of Housing Assistance Program on Labor Supply, Family Formation and Homeownership","This paper studies the effect of U.S. Housing Choice Voucher Program Section 8 on low income people's labor supply, family formation and homeownership. I analyze this issue using data from 2014 Panel and 2018 Panel of the restricted-use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). My economic approach is to use the policy assigning housing vouchers based on an income cutoff as an instrument to study the effect of housing vouchers on low-income people's employment, family formation and homeownership. The assignment policy states that households with income lower than 50% of the median income for the MSA/county area are eligible for housing vouchers. In order to infer the household eligibility status, I need the household MSA/county code, which is accessible through the SIPP restricted-use data. With household eligibility status, I compare the households whose incomes are slightly below the income cutoff (eligible households) with households whose incomes are slightly above the income cutoff (ineligible households) to identify the effect of housing vouchers on employment, family formation and homeownership. This project will contribute to understanding the effect of Section 8 Housing Voucher on low-income households' labor supply, family formation and homeownership decisions as well as the welfare implication of such housing assistance programs on low income households.","The Effect of Housing Assistance Program on Labor Supply and Family Formation","Ning Zhang, 2022.

"Drivers and Consequences of the Changing Distribution of Firms","We propose to study the implications of the changing firm distribution for macroeconomic dynamics and inequality in the United States since 1977. To precisely measure how rising industrial concentration has shifted the ownership of establishments toward multi-market firms, we plan to link multiple Census Bureau microdata sources, including the Annual Surveys, Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). We develop a flexible method for high-dimensional data to construct new annual estimates of establishment-level sales and productivity. This method deploys a Bayesian interpolation procedure on the sparse time series of establishment-level data from the five-year Economic Census to interpolate measures in missing years, incorporating a rich set of establishment-, firm-, and region-level characteristics. We will use these interpolated variables to examine the economic consequences of increasing concentration in two areas. First, our work studies the potential for large firms to amplify short-run economic fluctuations. We will examine how shocks to a large firm's financial health or technological capabilities can have persistent effects on regions due to spillovers onto workers and other businesses. We will also estimate the extent to which large, multi-unit firms make joint employment and investment decisions in a way that causes business cycle shocks to propagate across the regions or workers in the firm's network. Second, we will study how the expansion of large firms has contributed to longer-run trends in business dynamics, worker earnings, and regional inequality.","Credit Cycles, Firms, and the Labor Market","Blank, Michael and Omeed Maghzian. 2023.

"Medicare Savings Programs: Eligibility and Enrollment Trends","This project aims to fill gaps in knowledge about Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) by producing estimates of trends in the MSP participation rate, characteristics of the population eligible for and enrolled in MSPs, including information about out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, and examining the effect of a key policy change that aimed to increase MSP participation. We require non-public Census Bureau data to complete this project including the 2006-2017 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), 2006-2017 Medicare Enrollment DataBase (EDB), and 2006-2017 Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data. The SIPP data contain a large sample with accurate information on income, assets, marital status, and state of residence needed to simulate most criteria to identify the MSP-eligible population. The Medicare EDB and Medicaid MSIS data are needed to link to the SIPP to enable estimation of the final MSP-eligible population based on eligibility for Medicare Part A and to identify the MSP-enrolled population. Without the ability to link the non-public SIPP, EDB, and MSIS data sources, we would be unable to identify who is enrolled in MSPs to address any of the research questions of interest.","Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs): Eligibility and Enrollment Trends","Andrea Wysocki & Matthew Niedzwiecki & Evelyn Cody & Preeti Gill, 2023.

"Turn the Sailboat as the Wind Turns: Startup Relocation to and out of Clusters","Studies suggest that clusters, or the geographic concentration of firms in the same or related industries, facilitate entrepreneurship. Less understood is why some startups founded in clusters relocate out of clusters, and how the timing and destination of relocation impacts economic success. This study combines external data on startup funding and founder characteristics with the Longitudinal Business Register, Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, and Census data on commercial innovation to determine when and why startups relocate, how this impacts their workforce, and whether relocation affects startup performance. Results will shed light on previously unclear factors tied to the success or failure of startups, both at the company and worker-level, particularly in the tech industry.","Why do Firms Relocate out of Clusters?","Deng, Jing. 2023.

"The Impact of Medicare on Mortality","An important yet outstanding question is whether health insurance reduces mortality. Much of the previous literature has attempted to answer this question using population-level or aggregate data. If the mortality effects of health insurance are small, however, they will be difficult to detect without detailed data linking mortality records to individual characteristics that identify the individuals most likely to benefit from health insurance. We aim to study the effects of Medicare on mortality by examining whether mortality changes at the Medicare age-65 eligibility cutoff using a regression discontinuity framework. We link the ACS and Decennial Census data to the Numident file using PIK crosswalks. Importantly, the Numident records contain exact dates of birth and death for individuals with a Social Security Number, which allows us to precisely identify Medicare eligibility (our treatment) and death (our outcome variable). The large sample size and granular dates in the Numident file makes it more likely that we would be able to detect small changes in mortality. By linking administrative death records to information on individual survey data, we can potentially identify whether changes in mortality differ across socioeconomic characteristics such as income level and health insurance status. Additionally, we will examine whether the effects of Medicare on mortality change over time, such as before and after the introduction of the ACA.","The Effects of Public Health Insurance on Near-elderly Mortality","Arenberg, Samuel and Sam Stripling.

"U.S. Global Value Chains","International trade has changed enormously in the last couple of decades following the rise of global value chains. Understanding the links between importing upstream intermediate inputs and exporting more downstream output (with additional value-added) is crucial for studying how U.S. production processes adjust in response to global shocks, and how shocks to the U.S. can affect the global economy through supply-side channels. In this project, we aim to make progress by 1) substantially improving our understanding of how the rise of global value chains has impacted American manufacturing, 2) unpacking the latter's impact on each manufacturing industry, on American workers of different skill sets, and on local economies in distinct geographical region, and by 3) conducting model-based policy analysis, as well as simulations of U.S. and international ""shocks"" - such as the U.S.-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, to assess the role of GVCs, and the effects of such shocks on GVCs themselves.","Global Value Chains: Firm-Level Evidence from the U.S.","Flaaen, Aaron B., Fariha Kamal, Eunhee Lee, and Kei-Mu Yi. 2023.

"Search and Matching in the Venture Capital Industry","This project studies how entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists (VCs)' characteristics are related to their matching probability and investment performance. Three aspects of matches are examined: complementarity between entrepreneurs' quality and VCs' expertise, technological proximity between an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist inferred from patent data, and demographic characteristics. We utilize the LBD, iLBD, BR, CSB, SIRD, BRDIS, SBO, and ABS datasets from the Census Bureau. External datasets include VentureXpert, Preqin, Compustat, SDC Platinum, and the USPTO patent dataset. First, we implement reduced-form regressions to assess how observable characteristics of entrepreneurs and VCs are associated with matching probability and subsequent performance. Second, we construct a structural model that takes into account entrepreneur's unobserved quality and search frictions. By estimating the model, we infer the degree of complementarity and the effect of search frictions on aggregate performance in the venture capital industry. Finally, we construct a general equilibrium model to evaluate the impact of search frictions on aggregate productivity growth. Given that venture capital-backed startups account for a large fraction of successful businesses that generate breakthrough innovations and that VCs spend a considerable amount of time to find entrepreneurs, this project is important for understanding sources of economic growth.","Dynamics of High-Growth Young Firms and the Role of Venture Capitalists","Ando, Yoshiki. 2024.

"The role of finance in the production of industrial pollution: evidence from matched regulatory datasets","How do secure lenders' exposure to the environmental clean-up costs of their debtors affect their debtors' financial and economic outcomes? The relationship is theoretically ambiguous. Banks could reduce the quantity and maturity of credit, making financial constraints more binding and thus increasing the incentive of firms to pollute. However, banks could monitor their debtors and incentive them to reduce pollution. We could also expect a small and non-significant effect, as these constraints could not be binding. This paper studies this question by estimating difference-in-differences model exploiting several court rulings from the last three decades on a dataset constructed using EPA forms, Compustats as well as the LBD. The results are expected to shed light on the role of banks in affecting their debtor's collateral and inform policymakers on how to implement cost-effective policies to implement better pollution management practices.","Fresh Start or Fresh Water: The Impact of Environmental Lender Liability","Bellon, Aymeric, Fresh Start or Fresh Water: The Impact of Environmental Lender Liability (October 30, 2023).

"Volatility Shocks, Financial Frictions, and Worker Reallocation","This project studies the effect of volatility shocks on worker reallocation through the financial channel. When the volatility of firm-level productivity increases, firms are more likely to go bankrupt because of the higher likelihood of bad shocks, especially for firms with higher leverage. Since workers bear losses after their firms' bankruptcy, highly leveraged firms need to pay higher wages as compensation and hire less. Consequently, a positive volatility shock generates worker outflows from highly leveraged firms to lowly leveraged firms, amplifying the recession. We will use Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data which provides information on firms' employment, workers' earnings, and job transitions. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) supplements the LEHD files for more information on employment and other employer characteristics. We also prepare external data to supplement firms' financial information, including Compustat and the firm default probabilities calculated from the CRSP Daily Stock dataset. Compustat/CRSP will be linked to the County Business Patterns – Business Register (CBPBR) using the Compustat-SSEL Bridge (CSB). CBPBR also provides internal identifiers to link to LEHD and LBD. Our main empirical tools are multivariate regressions for panel data with fixed effects. We will conduct our empirical analyses at the individual-level (worker-level and firm-level) and worker-firm-level (job-level) to analyze the impact of volatility shocks on firms' employment decisions and default probabilities, workers' earnings, and job transition probabilities conditional on firms' leverage. We expect to find that when volatility increases, highly leveraged firms are associated with higher default risks, higher wages, lower employment, and higher separation probabilities.","Uncertainty and Unemployment Revisited: The Consequences of Financial and Labor Contracting Frictions","Yajie Wang, August 15, 2023, ""Uncertainty and Unemployment Revisited: The Consequences of Financial and Labor Contracting Frictions.""

"College Major Choice and Labor Market Matching","In this project, we plan to analyze the extent to which wages of workers that graduate in different majors grow at different speed over the workers' life. Using regression analysis controlling for individual fixed effects and the large longitudinal dataset obtained merging the ACS to the LEHD, we plan to estimate college major specific wage growth profiles.

In this project, we also plan to study the mechanisms underneath this heterogeneity. Utilizing the matched employee-employer nature of the LEHD and a double fixed effect specification as in Bonhomme et al (2020), we plan to analyze to what extent the observed patterns are driven by different assortative matching at the beginning of the workers' careers. For example, a slower wage growth profile for STEM workers, as previously estimated by Deming and Noray (2020), could be generated by the fact that these workers enter in the labor force better matched than workers with different degrees. 

Our analysis will also include other potential explanations, such as different industrial matching, i.e. the matching between an industry and the skills of the workers, and a discussion on the role of geographical sorting, estimating to which extent these patterns are generated by the fact that labor markets of different sizes employ workers from different majors. We finally plan to estimate whether workers of different degrees are able to absorb or learn skills from their coworkers with different intensities using a framework similar to Jarosh et al. (2021).","College Majors and Earnings Growth","Choi, Woosuk, Josh Kinsler, Alexis Orellana, and Ronni Pavan. November 2023.

"High-Tech Innovative Startups: Testing for the Leonardo Polymath Effect and Assessing the Contribution to Radical Innovation","The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship (Baumol 2010) provides a theoretical framework for locating the source of radical, market disrupting innovation in small firms. The newly available 2018 Annual Business Survey provides the ideal dataset for identifying these rare firms and for assessing their contribution to the Nation's science and engineering enterprise. The central empirical problem is differentiating the small firms operating in innovation markets--developing innovations that are made available to market-leading incumbents either through acquisition or licensing--from the much more numerous small firms operating in product markets.  This is likely to be a problem even among the subpopulation of R&D performing microbusinesses.  The project will use latent class analysis and information on founder characteristics, sources of revenue, the importance of intellectual property protection, and testing or use of esoteric technologies to derive a probabilistic measure of membership as an innovation market participant. 
Information on innovation market participants will be used to construct a longer time-series of such firms in BRDI-M (2016) and BRDIS (2008-2016) to map the trajectory of these firms through time with links to the Longitudinal Business Database and County Business Patterns Business Register.  The 2018 cross-sectional data will also be used to test whether innovation market participants operating in Zip Codes characterized by vibrant amateur arts activity have higher patenting productivity than peers located in arts deficient areas: a test of the Leonardo polymath effect where exemplary scientific or technological accomplishments are accompanied by participation in the arts.","Registered Report: Exploratory Analysis of Ownership Diversity and Innovation in the Annual Business Survey","Wojan, Timothy R. 2023.

"Reconciling the Quantitative Gap in Measuring the Social Costs of Gentrification: Evidence from the American Housing Survey","Recent contributions to the study of neighborhood gentrification remain heavily divided along methodological lines. Quantitative scholars consistently find little evidence of physical displacement within gentrifying areas, but are rarely able to assess the social impacts of gentrification on a wide scale. In this study, I aim to reconcile this gap through a two-step structural equation model and maximum likelihood regression analysis of the 2013 American Housing Survey's Neighborhood Social Capital variables. First, I assess how the multi-dimensional social costs and benefits of neighborhood change might be measured by incorporating these 21 variables into a latent factor analysis. Based on previous literature, I expect to find 5 latent measures of social experience. Then, utilizing longitudinal tract-level data from the American Community Survey, I classify each respondents' neighborhood as gentrifying or not. Using this classification as the primary independent variable, and controlling for various other household- and neighborhood-level factors from the AHS and ACS, I analyze the impact on the social experiences of long-time resident households. I expect to find that living in a gentrifying area is negatively associated with social capital, ties, and efficacy. Therefore, I refer to these impacts as the social costs of gentrification, and provide more nuance to quantitative research beyond the tracking of displaced households.","Whose Neighborhood Now?

"Heterogeneous Effects of Increasing Healthcare Costs on Local Firms","We study heterogeneity in the effects of rising healthcare costs on firms; for example, the effect of rising healthcare costs on smaller firms in comparison with larger ones, and if/how rising healthcare costs have contributed to increasing consolidation in non-healthcare industries. We explore this topic in three steps, employing a difference-in-differences approach in which hospital mergers serve as a shock to local healthcare costs and utilizing LBDREV, MEPS-IC, ACES, and CMF/ASM. We first study the health insurance outcomes of smaller firms in comparison with larger ones following a shock to healthcare costs, testing the hypothesis that smaller firms are price-takers with respect to health insurance premiums. Given heterogeneous increases in health insurance premiums, theory predicts that smaller firms will be unable to fully pass through costs to employees and will adjust on other margins; we next test this hypothesis by studying economic outcomes such as employment, entry, and exit. Finally, we study the effect of hospital mergers on firms' corporate finances (such as capital expenditures, financial leverage, revenues, and expenses) to provide insight into the channels through which these economic outcomes occur, for example, if lower employment following a shock to healthcare prices is a result of firms shifting from labor to capital or suffering from decreased profitability.","Effect of Increasing Healthcare Costs on Small Firms:

"Productivity and Efficiency Analysis in U.S. Food Manufacturing Industry","We will develop an unbiased measure of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and investigate the sources of productivity growth by analyzing management and organizational practices, technological change, efficiency, and scale effects at the establishment-and firm-levels in the US food and beverage products industry.  To generate consistent estimates of firm productivity and efficiency measures, we will estimate a flexible production function of a firm using innovative estimation techniques (e.g., stochastic frontier approach, production function approach) and take the issues of endogeneity and omitted variable bias into consideration.  Unbiased measures of production parameters will then be used to decompose TFP into components (e.g., scale effect, technological change effect, efficiency effect, managerial and organizational practices effect).  In our estimation, we will take into consideration of firm's heterogenous characteristics such as firms' age, location, size, ownership change status (mergers and acquisitions), managerial and organizational practices, and firm's export and import status. We will contribute to the existing literature by investigating the market power issues in both input and output markets since prior studies analyzing US food industries mainly focused on market power in output markets.  Specifically, we will incorporate the role of market power in the U.S. food industries by estimating markups and markdowns in output and input markets.","The Role of Managerial and Organizational Practices in Explaining Productivity Differences: A Study of U.S. Food Manufacturing Firms","Geylani, Pinar C., Timothy A.

"Parental Wealth, Post-Secondary Human Capital Investment, and Post-College Outcomes","My project aims to study the importance of parental financial resources on the post-secondary education outcomes of their children. To study this question, I will link adult children from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) to their parents in the 2000 Decennial Long Form and Short Form Censuses and the 2010 Decennial Long Form Census. With this data, I will use a generalized difference-in-differences framework to study the impact of local house price changes experienced by parents on undergraduate attendance and degree attainment, student loan debt burden to finance education, the quality and cost of undergraduate institution attended, and graduate school attendance.  My project will contribute to an existing literature studying the impact of parental financial resources on human capital investment by evaluating the importance of changes to parental wealth at different points in the life-cycle of adult children and by evaluating how the impact of local house-price changes has evolved during the 21st Century. In line with existing research, I expect to find that exposure to large positive increases in local housing values in the early 2000s leads to increased college attainment, and that exposure to large negative shocks from The Great Recession depressed human capital investment. It is unclear if the re-acceleration of housing values in the mid to late 2010s will have the same positive impact as increases in the early 2000s, as housing wealth has been less liquid during this time period.","The Impact of Parental Resources on Human Capital Investment and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from the Great Recession","Jeremy Kirk, 2024.

"Common Ownership, Labor Market Outcomes, and Corporate Investment: Establishment-Level Evidence","In this project, we study the effects of common ownership, the extent to which different firms share common owners, on employees at the establishment level. Common ownership has been increasing in the U.S. in the past four decades, and this phenomenon raised the alarm that a small number of giant asset managers could effectively control most large, publicly traded firms in the near future. Increased common ownership could increase firms' employer market power, which in turn could contribute to the wage stagnation since the 1970s. Although this argument is theoretically appealing, little is known about whether and how common ownership affects employees and capital investment in reality. To achieve our goal, we merge microdata in the Census, for example, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Census of Manufactures (CMF), and Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), with institutional ownership data from SEC Form 13F. In addition to canonical panel regressions, we further use a firm's addition to the S&P 500 index as a shock to the common ownership of its competitors in local labor markets and use a matched difference-in-differences analysis to identify causal impacts of common ownership. We expect that an increase in common ownership would lead to a decrease in employee earnings conditional on labor productivity. Our project contributes to the literature by being the first to document common ownership effects on employees.","Common Ownership in Labor Markets","Azar, José and Dai, Xin and Qiu, Yue and Sojourner, Aaron J., Common Ownership in Labor Markets (October 30, 2023).

"Labor Union Membership and the Baby Boom","The fundamental causes of the American Baby Boom are not well-understood. In particular, standard theories fail to predict its timing. I propose to shed new light on the origins of the Baby Boom by exploring a new channel: the effect of labor union membership on fertility. Following the passage of the 1935 Wagner Act, union membership rates more than tripled, and by the peak of the Baby Boom one-third of American workers were members of a labor union. Using the Decennial Census and novel historical data sources of union membership, I will test whether unionization is causally related to completed fertility and birth rates during this period.","Did Organized Labor Induce Labor?

"Military Service and Immigrants' Assimilation: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft Lotteries","Recent trends in global migration have raised questions surrounding immigrants' national identification and assimilation into the American mainstream. What explains variation in immigrants' integration choices? Although seminal theories in political science argue that military service is a critical driver of assimilation, some scholars have challenged the empirical basis and theoretical logic underpinning this relationship. A major obstacle bedeviling the study of military service and integration is self-selection: immigrants who are better assimilated may be more likely to join the military in the first place. We address the selection problem by examining the effects of military conscription during the Vietnam War using an instrumental variables approach. Conscription during the crucial years 1970-1972 was decided on the basis of national draft lotteries, which assigned draft numbers based on an individual's date of birth. We use the draft lottery to instrument for military service and estimate the causal effect of service on a range of integration outcomes using granular data from the decennial censuses. Our study thus contributes novel evidence to key debates on the implications of military service for assimilation and national identification, while also highlighting a potential role for public policy to encourage immigrant incorporation via national service.","Military Service and Immigrants’ Integration: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft Lotteries","Zhang, Nan, and Melissa M.

"How Productivity and Employment Growth are Associated with Innovation and the Impact of Design on Innovation and Firm Growth","The proposed research will assess the value of underutilized Census innovation measures for explaining differences in productivity and employment growth in firms, and to evaluate the value of design questions included in the 2022 Annual Business Survey. The first part of the project will link the Census and other innovation datasets to the 2012 and 2017 Economic Census to examine the firm and contextual covariates associated with product and process innovation, and to estimate models of employment and productivity growth. The innovation model specifications will then be used to assess whether auxiliary variables in both the ABS and Economic Census can predict product and process innovation behavior in firms among the much more numerous Economic Census respondents, for which the Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods could be applied in future research. The second part of the project will explore the relationship between design and firm business conditions and employment and payroll growth, using data from the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey and other sources. This research will provide insights into the economic impacts of innovation and the role of design in entrepreneurial activities.","Grassroots Design Meets Grassroots Innovation: Rural Design Orientation and Firm Performance","Timothy R.
