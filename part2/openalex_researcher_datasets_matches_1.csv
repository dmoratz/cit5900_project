The Opportunities and Challenges of Using Administrative Data Linkages to Evaluate Mobility,https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716214552780,"Since Alan Krueger’s christening of the Great Gatsby curve, there has been increased attention given to the relationship between inequality and intergenerational social mobility in the United States. Studying intergenerational mobility (IGM) requires longitudinal data across large spans of time as well as the ability to follow parents and children over multiple generations. Few longitudinal datasets meet this need. This article surveys available data and the current and potential issues surrounding the use of administrative records to vastly extend the study of IGM. First, we describe the U.S. Census Bureau’s current uses of administrative records in the linkage of households across household surveys such as the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), and the decennial censuses. Then, we describe the possibilities of creating additional parent-child linkages using the SIPP linked to decennial censuses and the ACS. Last, we outline our model to create linkages across earlier census data (e.g., 1980 and 1990) and contemporary surveys.",2014,12/10/2014,24,David Johnson; Catherine Massey; Amy O’Hara,,"Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,article,Amy B O'Hara,https://openalex.org/A5010637520,American Community Survey; BOC Best Race and Ethnicity Admin Records Modified,American Community Survey
Development of a multidimensional housing and environmental quality index (HEQI): application to the American Housing Survey,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-022-00866-8,"Abstract Background Substandard housing conditions and hazardous indoor environmental exposures contribute to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Housing indices that capture the multiple dimensions of healthy housing are important for tracking conditions and identifying vulnerable households. However, most indices focus on physical deficiencies and repair costs and omit indoor environmental exposures, as few national data sources routinely collect this information. Methods We developed a multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) based on the World Health Organization’s Housing and Health Guidelines and applied it to the 2019 American Housing Survey (AHS). The HEQI consisted of ten domains associated with poor health: household fuel combustion, dampness and mold, pests and allergens, lead paint risk, high indoor temperatures, low indoor temperatures, household crowding, injury hazards, inadequate water and sanitation, and ventilation. We evaluated the validity and performance of the HEQI against three housing characteristics (i.e., year built, monthly rent costs, unit satisfaction rating) and two established indices (i.e., Adequacy Index, Poor Quality Index). Results Approximately 79% (92 million) of U.S. households reported at least one HEQI domain associated with poor health (mean per household: 1.3; range: 0,8). Prevalent domains included household fuel combustion (61.4%), dampness and mold (15.9%), inadequate water and sanitation (14.3%), and injury hazards (11.9%). Pests and allergens, low indoor temperatures, and injury hazards were consistently associated with older homes, lower rent costs, and lower unit satisfaction. Compared to established housing indices, the HEQI captured four new environmental domains which enabled the identification of 57.7 million (63%) more households with environmental risk factors like mold, cockroaches, crowding, household fuel combustion, and higher building leakage. Conclusions Indoor environmental exposures are prevalent in U.S. households and not well-captured by existing housing indices. The HEQI is a multidimensional tool that can be used to monitor indoor environmental exposures and housing quality trends in the U.S. Some domains, including radon, pesticides, asbestos, noise, and housing accessibility could not be assessed due to the lack of available data in the AHS. The mounting evidence linking residential environmental exposures with adverse health outcomes underscore the need for this data in the AHS and other national surveys.",2022,5/24/2022,18,MyDzung T.

Development of a Multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI): Application to the American Housing Survey,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1342732/v1,"Abstract Background : Substandard housing conditions and hazardous environmental exposures indoors contribute to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Housing indices that capture the multiple dimensions of healthy housing are important for tracking conditions over time and identifying vulnerable households. However, most indices focus on physical deficiencies and repair costs and omit indoor environmental exposures, as few data sources routinely collect this data at the national level. Methods : We developed a national, multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) based on the World Health Organization’s Housing and Health Guidelines and applied it to the national American Housing Survey (AHS) 2019 data. The HEQI consisted of ten domains associated with poor health: indoor combustion sources, dampness and mold, pests and allergens, lead paint risk, high indoor temperatures, low indoor temperatures, household crowding, injury hazards, inadequate water and sanitation, and ventilation. We evaluated the validity and performance of the HEQI against three housing characteristics (i.e., year built, monthly rent costs, unit satisfaction rating) and two established indices (i.e., Adequacy index, Poor Quality Index). Results : Approximately 79% (92 million) of U.S. households reported at least one HEQI risk factor (mean per household: 1.5; range: 0,19). Common risk factors included indoor combustion sources (e.g. gas stoves, fireplaces) (62.0%), dampness and mold (15.4%), inadequate water and sanitation (11.7%), and injury hazards (11.6%). Prevalence of pest and allergens, low indoor temperature, and injury hazards were associated with older housing, lower rent costs, and worse unit satisfaction. Compared to established housing indices, the HEQI captured four new environmental domains and at least 62% (57.7 million) more households with environmental risk factors like mold, cockroaches, crowding, indoor combustion sources, and higher building leakage.

Toward a Cross-Platform Framework: Assessing the Comprehensiveness of Online Rental Listings.,,"Research on rental housing markets in the United States has traditionally relied on national or local housing surveys. Those sources lack temporal and spatial specificity, limiting their use for tracking short-term changes in local markets. As rental housing ads have transitioned to digital spaces, a growing body of literature has utilized web scraping to analyze listing practices and variations in rental market dynamics. Those studies have primarily relied on one platform, Craigslist, as a source of data. Despite Craigslist's popularity, the authors contend that rental listings from various websites, rather than from individual ones, provide a more comprehensive picture. Using a mixed-methods approach to study listings across various platforms in five metropolitan areas, this article demonstrates considerable variation in both the types of rental units advertised and the features provided across those platforms. The article begins with an account of the birth and consolidation of online rental platforms and emergent characteristics of several selected websites, including the criteria for posting, search parameters, search results priority, and first-page search results. Visualizations are used to compare features such as the 40th percentile of rent, rent distribution, and bedroom size based on scraped data from six online platforms (Padmapper, Forrent.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and GoSection8), 2020 Fair Market Rents, and 2019 American Community Survey data. The analyses indicate that online listing platforms target different audiences and offer distinct information on units within those market segments, resulting in markedly different estimates of local rental costs and unit size distribution depending on the platform.",2021,1/1/2021,4,Ana Vitória Monteiro Costa; Victoria Sass; Ian Kennedy; Roshni Roy; Rebecca J.

Stereotypical Hate Crimes and Criminal Justice Processing: A Multi-Dataset Comparison of Bias Crime Arrest Patterns by Offender and Victim Race,https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2017.1399211,"Many hate crimes are not reported and even fewer hate crimes result in an arrest. This study investigates patterns of victim reporting and arrest for hate crimes in two parts. First, using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, we find that, controlling for offense severity, hate crimes are less likely than non-bias crimes to be reported to the police and that the police are less likely to take further action for hate crimes, compared to non-hate crimes. Second, we use data from the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and the National Incident-Based Reporting System to compare differences between types of hate crimes in the likelihood of crime clearance. We find that those hate crimes most likely to result in arrest are those that fit the profile of a ""stereotypical"" hate crime: violent incidents, incidents committed by hate groups, and incidents involving white offenders and black victims.",2017,11/13/2017,61,Brendan Lantz; Andrew S.

Severity matters: The moderating effect of offense severity in predicting racial differences in reporting of bias and nonbias victimization to the police.,https://doi.org/10.1037/lhb0000477,"Previous research has noted contradictory findings regarding race and police notification, such that Black people indicate higher levels of distrust in the police yet report victimization to the police at rates similar to or higher than others. We investigated the role of offense severity in accounting for these discrepancies.We hypothesized that severity would moderate racial differences in reporting, such that Black victims would be less likely to report less severe victimization but more likely to report more severe victimization. We expected that these differences would be less pronounced for bias-motivated crime, regardless of other markers of severity.We used data from the 2003-2016 National Crime Victimization Survey, including information on 21,510 victimization incidents, 1,105 of which were hate crimes. We conducted logistic regression analyses in which reporting was regressed on victim race, offense severity, hate crime status, and control variables. We also examined interactive effects to disentangle whether severity moderated racial differences in notification.We observed a three-way interaction of Black victims, offense severity, and hate crime status. Specifically, for nonbias incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report severe incidents, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonsevere incidents. Additionally, for nonsevere incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report hate crimes, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonhate crimes.Offense severity plays an important role in the victim decision-making process. These patterns are different, however, by race and for hate crime victims, suggesting that people perceive hate crimes as important to report, regardless of their severity.

Following this, the current research examines the influence of co-offending on the decision to notify police using information from the National Crime Victimization Survey. Results indicate that the co-offending is significantly and positively related to the likelihood of notification. Findings further indicate that this relationship is moderated by co-offender characteristics, such that young co-offenders and, to a lesser extent, male co-offenders are more likely than their counterparts to be reported to police. These results have important implications for understanding the invocation of both formal social control and disparities in these processes, indicating that co-offending not only has a direct effect on notification, but that it also changes the effect of offender characteristics on this decision.",2022,9/12/2022,2,Brendan Lantz; Marin R.

A Comparative Efficiency Analysis of Cooperative and Non-cooperative Dairy Manufacturing Firms,,"Due to differences in ownership structure between cooperative and non-cooperative firms (NCFs), it has been hypothesized that co-ops may be less efficient than their non-cooperative counterparts. Illiquidity of owners’ investment and democratic governance may lead to underinvestment and managerial shirking in cooperative firms, both technical inefficiency sources, and the lack of a clear profit motive generates “inefficient” (relative to a profit-maximizing firm) economic decisions. This is especially true in the dairy product manufacturing sector, where production is capital intensive and factors leading to non-optimal investment decisions may have a large impact on efficiency. In this research we will use a unique dataset that includes plant level panel data for dairy product manufacturers from the Census of Manufactures encompassing the years 1977-2007 to determine whether there is a difference in plant level efficiency between cooperative firms and NCFs, as well as the source of any measured inefficiency.

Do Parents Matter for Student Loan Repayment after Graduation?,https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211072683,"Previous studies suggest that a college degree is the great equalizer leveling the playing field. However, the rapidly growing educational debt of college graduates might restrict their life chances throughout adulthood, particularly for those raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. This study uses data from the National Survey of College Graduates to examine whether parents’ socioeconomic status is related to their children’s student loan repayment after graduation. Holding the amount borrowed for completing higher education constant, college graduates with less educated parents hold a larger amount of educational debt in adulthood compared with their counterparts with more educated parents. The association between family background and student loan repayment remains significant with the addition of controls for various covariates related to college graduates’ education, occupation, income, and other labor market outcomes. This study suggests that educational debt burdens imposed on individual college graduates limit the meritocratic power of higher education.",2022,1/1/2022,7,Byeongdon Oh,Portland State University,"Higher Education Research Studies; Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",Socius Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,article,Byeongdon Oh,https://openalex.org/A5027696519,National Survey of College Graduates; BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),National Survey of College Graduates
Changing Undergraduate Funding Mix and Graduate Degree Attainment,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2023.2171210,"Previous studies of the role of college students' funding sources in their educational outcomes have focused on individual funding sources and have not paid much attention to the mixing of multiple sources. As rising college tuition has heightened the financial burden on college students, the use of multiple funding sources has become an adaptive funding strategy for completing a college degree. Using discrete funding-source information from the National Survey of College Graduates, this study offers the first exploration of the change in funding mixes across three cohorts — born in 1953–1962, 1963–1972, and 1973–1982 respectively — and their association with graduate degree attainment. The proportion of students who utilized only one or two funding sources decreased, while those who juggled three or more sources increased. Contrary to the oldest cohort, for whom the association between undergraduate funding mix and graduate degree attainment was relatively weak, in the recent cohort, students mobilizing multiple sources became less likely to obtain a graduate degree compared to those fully funded by their families.",2023,1/31/2023,2,Byeongdon Oh; ChangHwan Kim,"University of California, Berkeley; University of Kansas",Higher Education Research Studies; Higher Education Governance and Development; Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies,The Journal of Higher Education,article,Byeongdon Oh,https://openalex.org/A5027696519,National Survey of College Graduates; BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),National Survey of College Graduates

IPUMS Redesign,https://doi.org/10.1080/01615440309601210,"Abstract This new project will create two large parallel series of historical U.S. census microdata. The first is a redesigned Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) incorporating Census 2000 and the American Community Survey. The IPUMS is a compatible series of large census microdata samples spanning the period from 1850 to 2000. The second is a restricted-use micro-data archive containing 1.4 billion records from the censuses of 1940 to 2000. The new restricted-use archive is the product of a Census Bureau initiative to harmonize all of the bureau's decennial microdata and make them accessible through the Census Bureau Research Data Centers. The project will collaborate with the Census Bureau to create coding schemes to be used in both series that incorporate all detail in the restricted files. The two series will be developed simultaneously using the same software, methodology, and documentation.

Measuring Migration: Profiling Residential Mobility across Two Decades,https://doi.org/10.1177/193672440900300203,"The demography of a local population is a central aspect of applied social science research. Although birth and death rates influence a population, the key contributing factor influencing the demographics of a locality is almost always internal migration—the movement of persons between U.S. regions, states, and localities. Current definitions of internal migration used by the U.S. Census Bureau are limited because confidentiality restrictions require that detailed current and former place of residence geographic information be suppressed in publicly available files. In this paper we report the results of our work with confidential versions of the 1990 and 2000 decennial census microdata to develop an improved measurement of migration in order to develop a profile of internal migration in the United States. We perform our analysis for two contrasting time periods, 1985–1990 and 1995–2000. Our interest here is to assess the stability of the profile of migrants during a time period of economic contraction and expansion. Using confidential internal versions of the 1990 and 2000 Census long-form microdata, we estimate logistic models of the likelihood that individuals will migrate. The geographic detail in the internal Census data permits us to measure migration in ways that are not possible with public-domain Census data on persons. We develop migration definitions that distinguish between local residential mobility likely associated with life course transitions from migration out of the labor market area that may be driven more by employment and other socioeconomic considerations. Using logistic modeling, we find that the same individual attributes predict migration reasonably well during both periods. We also compute some illustrative probabilities of migration that show temporal stability in migration predictors could be lessened by certain changes in population composition.",2009,9/1/2009,11,Charles M.

Leaving Home: Modeling the Effect of Civic and Economic Structure on Individual Migration Patterns,,"This research analyzes the effect of community structure upon individuals' probabilities of moving between 1985 and 1990. Using the full Census sample long form microdata for 1990, we re-allocate adult persons in 1990 to their 1985 county of residence. Then, using origin county macro-structural variables (derived from the Economic Census microdata) and individual characteristics (from Decennial Census microdata), we develop a two level hierarchical linear model. In level 1, we construct a logistic equation modeling individual probabilities of moving. In level 2, we model the contextual effects of origin community structure on these models. These contextual effects fall into two categories: 1) economic conditions that comprise the usual aggregate 'push' factors and 2) civic community factors that act to retain people in their community. Results specify the relationship between community context and individual migration patterns, and demonstrate effects of local economic structure and local civic structure on these individual probabilities. Most notably, we find that civic attributes of communities are associated with a propensity to stay in place, net of community economic factors and individual characteristics.",2002,6/1/2002,4,Alfred Nucci; Charles M.

Community Banks and Loans for Nonmetropolitan Businesses: A Multilevel Analysis from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12182,"Abstract Access to financial capital is vital for the sustainability of the local business sector in nonmetropolitan communities. In this article we develop two hypotheses and examine the impact of financial sector restructuring on the odds of using a bank loan to finance a new business or expand an existing business. Focusing on nonmetropolitan American businesses, we connect restricted tabulations of the 2007 Survey of Business Owners to data on the commuting zones (CZ) in which businesses are located. We use multilevel logistic regression models to predict the effects of community bank presence within the CZ on the odds of using a bank business loan to start or expand a business for nonmetropolitan businesses started or purchased since 2000. Net of important characteristics of the businesses and owners, we find that the greater the proportion of local banks in a nonmetropolitan CZ, the greater the odds that a conventional business loan was used to either help start a new business or expand an existing business.",2017,7/28/2017,5,F.

Restructuring of the Financial Industry and Implications for Sources of Start-Up Capital for New Businesses in Nonmetropolitan Counties *,,"Historically, in small towns throughout rural America local banks had formed symbiotic relationships with local businesses. The flow of capital was lubricated by the personal relationships and trust that developed between local banks and business owners. However, over the past 20 years changes in interstate banking laws have led to a flurry of mergers and acquisitions resulting in a national consolidation of bank firms.1 This consolidation was followed by a proliferation of establishments at the local level, many of which were former independent and regional banks that serviced local businesses (Boot 2011; Devaney and Weber 1995; Berger and Udell 1995; Berger and Black 2007). Issues affecting the sources of financing are of interest to rural sociologists (Green 1984; 1986). At the core of research on civic community and socioeconomic well-being in rural communities is a strong, independent middle class consisting of local leaders, entrepreneurs, and local small business owners (Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998; Blanchard, Tolbert and Mencken 2012; Tolbert et al. 2002). Entrepreneurs need start-up capital to launch a new business. Likewise, current local business owners need access to capital to keep their businesses functioning, and to expand their operations (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Jarmin 2008; Black and Strahan 2002).In this research note we provide descriptive analyses of sources of financing for new business start-ups in nonmetropolitan counties using data from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO). We present data on the sources of start-up capital for new business in nonmetropolitan counties and propose that there is a distinct decline in the use of bank loans over the decades. We also document a potential increase in use of riskier alternative sources, including credit cards over the past 30 years. Our analysis is unique in that we use confidential tabulations of the 2007 SBO at the Census Research Data Center to compare nonmetropolitan businesses with metropolitan businesses and publically available national trends.2At issue are the implications of changes in banking laws, such as the 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act, beyond merger and acquisitions, and improvements in communications technology (Whaling 1996; Cetorelli and Strahan 2006), that have led to firm-level consolidation in traditional financial services industry over the last 30 years. While many believe that this has increased access to customers and capital for some, there are potentially significant implications for businesses started by local entrepreneurs (De Young, Glennon, and Nigro 2008; Kilkenny 2002; Shaffer and Collender 2008).BACKGROUNDThe banking industry has been one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Before 1994, local banks were protected against interstate and intrastate competition, as state legislatures decided which banks could establish branches and subsidiaries within the state. At the federal level, the banking industry was governed by two important pieces of legislation: the McFadden Act of 1927 and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act. These laws put severe restrictions on interstate banking, and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act required that all bank holding companies (BHCs) fall under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Omarova and Tahyar 2011).3 The 1956 legislation was intended to limit the spatial expansion of large banking groups and their monopolization of local credit markets. However, many BHCs managed to circumvent the interstate restrictions. In 1993, 42 states still prohibited interstate banking, but there was considerable interstate banking activity, just done extremely inefficiently (Nippani and Green 2002; Zou, Miller and Malamud 2011).The 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act sought to remove the inefficiencies and ease the interstate banking restrictions. The impact was argued to be beneficial for banks, businesses, and consumers. …",2016,1/1/2016,7,F. Carson Mencken; Charles M.

"The Mental Health Consequences of George Floyd’s Murder in Minneapolis in Black, Latine, and White Communities",https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwae359,"The high-profile police murder of George Floyd is likely to have an aftermath of negative health consequences, particularly among Black people. Our study evaluates the impact of the murder of Mr. Floyd on mental health in Black, Latine, and white communities in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We constructed a panel dataset merging data from the Minnesota Hospital Association, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minneapolis Police Department, and American Community Survey. First, we specify an overall and racial subgroup autoregressive interrupted time-series design to identify the impact of the murder on rates of mental health hospital discharge at the city-level. We then examine the spatial heterogeneity in the impact of the murder by specifying zip code tabulation area (ZCTA)-level panel models. We find a 0.23 per 1,000 increase in mental health conditions among Black people in the immediate post-murder period, followed by a weekly decline (-.007) in mental health diagnoses. We do not find a substantial rate increase in White or Latine residents. Further, our analyses at the ZCTA-week-level corroborate these findings, while showing that the increase for Black residents was global. These findings speak to the traumatizing effects of police violence and the short- and longer-term public health consequences for Black communities.",2024,9/13/2024,1,N.

Does ethnoracial context diversity predict implicit associations of sexual orientation? Evidence from linked Census Bureau and Implicit Association Test data,https://doi.org/10.1177/13684302241290919,"We examined whether exposure to context diversity in one domain relates to mental associations in another social domain. County-level metrics of racial diversity and segregation computed from restricted-use U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data were linked to a geolocated measure of sexual orientation implicit bias from over 825,000 respondents across the United States (2015–2021). Multilevel models revealed that living in more racially diverse counties was related to less stereotypic implicit associations of sexual orientation, and this relationship was moderated by racial segregation. This primary result was evaluated through a series of robustness checks. Weighted models accounting for the nonrepresentative nature of the sample revealed a robust association with diversity but not an interaction with segregation. The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to social diversity in one domain can generalize to intergroup attitudes in another domain. These results also highlight the dynamic interaction between an individual and their social environment, bolstering the need for socially contextualized research on human cognition.",2024,12/9/2024,0,Mehrgol Tiv; Cody Spence,United States Census Bureau; United States Census Bureau,Social and Intergroup Psychology; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Social and Cultural Dynamics,Group Processes & Intergroup Relations,article,Cody B Spence,https://openalex.org/A5054054111,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS); American Community Survey; Current Population Survey March Supplement,American Community Survey
Industrial Facility Combustion Energy Use,https://doi.org/10.7799/1278644,"Facility-level industrial combustion energy use is calculated from greenhouse gas emissions data reported by large emitters (>25,000 metric tons CO2e per year) under the U.S. EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP, https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting).

Are Anatomy PhDs Nearing Extinction or Adapting to Change? United States Graduate Education Trends in the Anatomical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2013,"Faculty qualified to teach in the anatomical sciences are growing scarce just as the need for trained anatomists is greater than ever. Enrollments are surging in anticipation of a large physician shortfall; meanwhile, many anatomists are reaching retirement age. Who will fill the teaching gap? This study assessed trends in doctorates awarded in Anatomy and related fields within the United States (US) since 1969 and evaluated modern graduate education in the anatomical sciences. Data were compiled from the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates. The total number of doctorates in the anatomical sciences and number of doctorates by sex and race/ethnicity were plotted for trend analysis. The number of PhD anatomy training programs within US medical schools was also assessed. Curricula and major characteristics of all active programs were evaluated through website searches and program director interviews. While doctorates in cell biology, developmental biology, and neuroscience have grown, the number of PhDs awarded in Anatomy has declined, on average, by 3.1 graduates per year to a 50-year low of only 8 graduates in 2017. Currently, 21 active doctoral programs in anatomy operate within US medical schools and fall into three general categories: anatomy education (n = 8), classic anatomy (n = 8), and anthropology/evolutionary anatomy (n = 5). Without a concerted effort by stakeholders to address the shortage, anatomists may face extinction. Expansion of the anatomy education doctoral degree may represent a necessary evolution of the field to meet job market needs and to thwart the extinction threat.",2020,8/28/2020,16,Adam B.

Update on the state of the anatomy educator shortage,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2303,"Anatomy education is a cornerstone of health professions education. With the expansive growth of graduate and health professions programs, increased student enrollments, and the advancement of new medical techniques and technologies, the demand for anatomy education is robust. At the time of this editorial, within the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico there were 330 masters level nursing programs ((AACN) AAoCoN, n.d.), 329 speech-language pathology programs (CAA, n.d.), 300 physician assistant programs (ARC-PA, n.d.), 300 physical therapy programs (CAPTE, n.d.), 248 occupational therapy programs (ACOTE, n.d.), 198 osteopathic and allopathic medicine programs (LCME, n.d.; Association AO, n.d.), 70 dental medicine programs (CODA, n.d.), and 32 veterinary medicine programs (Association AVM, n.d.). Anatomy curricula, in some form, are common among these most popular health professions programs. However, with a limited supply of anatomy educators entering the workforce (Wilson et al., 2020, 2021; Edwards et al., 2022), hiring well-qualified individuals to teach the anatomical sciences is presently a challenge. The identified supply and demand mismatch has brought anatomy job market trends into the limelight and raises the question, “Are we, as a profession, equipped to meet the current and future needs of the health education market?” The anatomy educator shortage was first reported in 1961 when Eldred and Eldred observed an imbalance in teaching faculty as the number of medical schools expanded (Eldred & Eldred, 1961). In 2002, 41 years later, a national survey found that more than 80% of chairpersons anticipated difficulty in recruiting and hiring qualified anatomy educators (Holden, 2003). More recent reports, as of 2020, have explored the anatomy educator shortage from a variety of viewpoints including chairperson perspectives (Wilson et al., 2020), American Association for Anatomy (AAA) annual job posting outcomes (Wilson et al., 2020), National Science Foundation (NSF) outcomes from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (Wilson et al., 2021), and AAA membership retirement intentions (Edwards et al., 2022). Collectively, this information points to a continued and widening shortage of anatomy educators. Over the past seven years, from 2016 to 2022, AAA job postings for anatomy educators have increased by 60% at an average rate of six additional postings per year (Figure 1; R2 = 0.56). In 2022, the AAA job board hosted 128 openings for anatomy educator positions across US and Canadian medical, health professions, and undergraduate institutions (Figure 1). These 128 postings for anatomy educator positions were collated from a larger list of 184 AAA job postings. Duplicate postings were defined as postings for the same position, at the same institution, that were posted over multiple sequential time periods throughout the course of the year. Duplicate postings and positions for postdoctoral trainees, chairpersons, administrators, basic science researchers, clinical positions, or adjunct/part-time faculty were excluded from the analysis. Fewer job postings in 2020 were likely a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Edwards et al., 2022). The proportion of schools that have posted job openings consecutively from one year to the next has remained relatively constant over time and has not exceeded 25% of the total number of postings (Figure 2). As such, most job postings each year represented new/unique openings. The job advertisements posted across consecutive years predominately represented postings that first opened late in the calendar year (e.g., November) and lingered as unfilled positions into the next calendar year. Limited information in the AAA dataset prevented clear delineation between new versus lingering unfilled positions across consecutive years. Changes to the AAA job posting intake form are needed to yield a richer and more precise dataset. Additionally, a separate future analysis is needed to discern why certain schools take longer to fill their open positions than others, a possible byproduct of geographic characteristics, institutional factors, and the selectivity of searching anatomists (i.e., it is currently an employee's market). Based on job postings alone, the current market suggests a positive outlook for the future of the anatomy education job market. Previously, Wilson et al. reported a 5-year forecast, through 2025, regarding the number of PhD graduates expected to enter the workforce based on NSF data and the number of graduates that would be needed for the profession to reestablish a state of homeostasis (i.e., an equilibrium in the supply versus demand) (Wilson et al., 2021). Since this report, the number of PhD graduates reported by 62% (13 of 21) of active anatomy PhD programs has closely mirrored the projected estimate of 22 graduates per year (Figure 3). While 2023 is anticipated to yield at least 30 PhD anatomy graduates, these numbers (from 2020 to 2023; Figure 3) still fall short of the forecasted need of 40 to 51 graduates per year, through 2025. These forecasts did not account for faculty retirements, which now are estimated at approximately 40 per year, through at least 2026 (Edwards et al., 2022). Although job posting increases suggest a positive outlook for the profession, the trickling pipeline of anatomy PhD graduates entering the workforce is barely able to keep pace with faculty retirements, let alone fill the needs of new and expanding programs (Edwards et al., 2022). According to the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates dataset, over a three-year period, from 2019 to 2021, 20 different schools graduated at least one individual with a PhD in anatomy. The additional need to staff new programs, and existing programs with increased enrollments, will inevitably place further strain on the anatomy educator shortage. These outcomes suggest that within the foreseeable future, unless deliberate actions are taken and sustainable streams of financial support are identified, the supply of PhD-trained anatomists will continue to trail behind the growing health professions' demand for anatomy education. Without an adequate supply of anatomy educators, departments may come to rely more heavily on retirees, masters-trained individuals, and/or faculty from other related disciplines, which has the potential to increase demands for additional professional development (Wilson et al., 2018). While similar supply and demand misalignments may be occurring internationally, this dataset cannot be generalized to health education markets in other countries. The outcomes reported herein relied solely on the AAA job board. These numbers may be underestimates of the job market demand as they may not fully capture open positions posted through other sources. Future investigations that include data from additional job boards (e.g., American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA), Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS)) are needed to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of the anatomy education job market. Continued annual monitoring of the anatomy educator job market is necessary for identifying gaps and recognizing areas for improvement. However, simply tracking numbers without strategically developing and implementing a solution to reverse the shortage is not enough. To use an analogy, we must not allow a “threatened” species to become “endangered” without considering a need for intervention. To make a concerted effort to reverse the anatomy educator shortage will require input, cooperation, and coordination between anatomy PhD programs, departments, and professional associations. Instead of merely pontificating about the anatomy educator shortage, we must actively work to devise practical solutions to help turn the tide. Remaining idle at this critical juncture and failing to capitalize on our profession's unique growth opportunity will only result in stagnation within our community and perhaps a further loss of identity among anatomists.

Forced-Choice Versus Open-Ended Versions of the Field of Bachelor's Degree Question in the 2007 ACS Content Test,,"The U.S. Census Bureau conducted the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS) Content Test from July through September 2007. As part of the test, the Census Bureau tested two versions, a forced-choice version and an openended version, of a new question proposed for inclusion in the ACS. The question collects information from respondents about the field(s) of study of their bachelor’s degree. In the open-ended version of the question, the respondent lists the specific field(s) of degree. The forced-choice version consists of eight categories for the respondent to indicate whether or not a person’s field of degree could be classified into each of the categories listed. Half of the selected sample addresses were randomly assigned the openended version, while the other half received the forced-choice version. Standard ACS data collection procedures were used to collect data for the 2007 ACS Content Test. Additionally, to test the reliability and consistency of respondents’ answers to the field of degree questions, a Content Follow-Up reinterview was conducted by telephone during which respondents were asked both versions of the question. Respondents were asked the same version they received in the original interview first, followed by the other version. This paper will present a comparison of the two versions of the field of degree question including overall response distributions, item nonresponse rates, comparability with existing data sources, response consistency, and reliability measures.",2008,1/1/2008,0,Mary Frances; E.

Assessing the Impact of Differential Privacy on Measures of Population and Racial Residential Segregation,https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.5cd8024e,"The U.S. Census Bureau plans to use a new disclosure avoidance technique based on differential privacy to protect respondent confidentiality for the 2020 Decennial Census of Population and Housing.Their new technique injects noise based on a number of parameters into published statistics.While the noise injection does protect respondent confidentiality, it achieves the protection at the cost of less accurate data.To better understand the impact that differential privacy has on accuracy, we compare data from the complete-count 1940 Census with multiple differentially private versions of the same data set.We examine the absolute and relative accuracy of population counts in total and by race for multiple geographic levels, and we compare commonly used measures of residential segregation computed from these data sets.We find that accuracy varies by the global privacy-loss budget and the allocation of the privacy-loss budget to geographic levels (e.g., states, counties, enumeration district) and queries.For measures of segregation, we observe situations where the differentially private data indicate less segregation than the original data and situations where the differentially private data indicate more segregation than the original data.The sensitivity of accuracy to the overall global privacy-loss budget and its allocation highlight the fundamental importance of these policy decisions.Data producers like the U.S. Census Bureau must collaborate with users not only to determine the most useful set of parameters to receive allocations of the privacy-loss budget, but also to provide documentation and tools for users to gauge the reliability and validity of statistics from publicly released data products.If they do not, producers may create statistics that are unusable or misleading for the wide variety of use cases that rely on those statistics.",2022,6/24/2022,11,Brian J.

This allows for a new approach to estimating the aggregate elasticity using microeconomic data and allows us to examine how the aggregate elasticity varies over time or across countries. We then use plant level data from the Census of Manufactures to construct an aggregate elasticity of substitution for the manufacturing sector, and estimate an aggregate elasticity of approximately 0.72 in 1987. We find that the aggregate elasticity has risen over time in the US and is higher in less developed countries.

How should we Define “Rural” when Investigating Rural Tobacco use in the United States?,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1856292,"Purpose: Investigations into rural tobacco-related disparities in the U.S. are hampered by the lack of a standardized approach for identifying the rurality-and, consequently, the urbanicity-of an area. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the most common urban/rural definitions (Census Bureau, OMB, RUCA, and Isolation) and determine which is preferable for explaining the geographic distribution of several tobacco-related outcomes (behavior, receiving a doctor's advice to quit, and support for secondhand smoke policies). Methods: Data came from The Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement. For each tobacco-related outcome, one logistic regression was conducted for each urban/rural measure. Models were then ranked according to their ability to explain the data using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: Each definition provided very different estimates for the prevalence of the U.S. population that is considered ""rural"" (e.g., 5.9% for the OMB, 17.0% for the Census Bureau). The OMB definition was most sensitive at detecting urban/rural differences, followed by the Isolation scale. Both these measures use strict, less-inclusive criteria for what constitutes ""rural."" Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate the heterogeneity across urban/rural measures. Although findings do not provide a definitive answer for which urban/rural definition is the best for examining rural tobacco use, they do suggest that the OMB and Isolation measures may be most sensitive to detecting many types of urban/rural tobacco-related disparities.

"Hispanic Disaster Preparedness in the United States, 2017: Examining the Association with Residential Characteristics.",,"The number of highly destructive disasters is increasing in regions of the United States where the Hispanic population is growing fastest. Up-to-date studies of disaster preparedness are needed that include housing measures and other factors that may account for differences in disaster preparedness between Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups. This study fills this gap in the literature by using data from the 2017 American Housing Survey, which includes a topical module on disaster planning along with the core measures of housing and neighborhood characteristics, including housing tenure. The results reveal that Hispanics are generally less prepared than non-Hispanic Whites regarding resource- and action-based measures, with a few exceptions. Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians are significantly more likely than Whites to have at least 3 gallons of water per person, and Hispanics and Blacks are significantly more likely than Whites and Asians to have flood insurance. The findings show that housing and residential characteristics are consistently significant in predicting preparedness-controlling for other relevant variables-although they do not attenuate the disadvantages that Hispanics and Blacks face in their disaster preparedness relative to Whites. Future research would benefit from further exploration of the linkage between racial and ethnic inequalities in housing and neighborhood characteristics and household disaster preparedness.",2021,1/1/2021,4,Samantha Friedman; Elizabeth Fussell; Mayuko Nakatsuka; Recai Yucel,"University at Albany, State University of New York; John Brown University; University at Albany, State University of New York; Temple College; Temple University",Disaster Management and Resilience; Flood Risk Assessment and Management; Tropical and Extratropical Cyclones Research,PubMed,article,Elizabeth Fussell,https://openalex.org/A5020641779,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF); Household Pulse Survey; American Housing Survey,American Housing Survey

Most research in this area has been limited to specific crime types (e.g., sexual assault), or it has not taken into account possible changes in the characteristics of incidents associated with police notification. In this article, we advance knowledge about long‐term trends in the reporting of crime to the police by using data from the National Crime Survey (NCS) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and methods that take into account possible changes in the factors that affect reporting at the individual and incident level as well as changes in survey methodology. Using data from 1973 to 2005, our findings show that significant increases have occurred in the likelihood of police notification for sexual assault crimes as well as for other forms of assault and that these increases were observed for violence against women and violence against men, stranger and nonstranger violence, as well as crimes experienced by members of different racial and ethnic groups. The reporting of property victimization (i.e., motor vehicle theft, burglary, and larceny) also increased across time. Overall, observed increases in crime reporting account for about half of the divergence between the NCVS and the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) in the estimated magnitude of the 1990s crime decline—a result that highlights the need to corroborate findings about crime trends from multiple data sources.",2010,2/1/2010,227,Eric P.

Controlling for both individual‐ and neighborhood‐level conditions, our findings indicate that within traditional immigrant counties, rates of violence reporting in immigrant neighborhoods are similar to those observed elsewhere. In contrast, within newer immigrant destinations, we observe much lower rates of violence reporting in neighborhoods with a large concentration of immigrants.

This data-infrastructure limitation has hindered scientific understanding of whether immigrants are more or less likely than native-born Americans to be criminally victimized and how victimization may vary among immigrants of different statuses. We address these issues in the present study by using new data from the 2017-2018 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to explore the association between citizenship status and victimization risk in a nationally representative sample of households and persons aged 12 years and older. The research is guided by a theoretical framing that integrates insights from studies of citizenship with the literature on immigration and crime, as well as theories of victimization. We find that a person's foreign-born status (but not their acquired U.S. citizenship) confers protection against victimization. We also find that the protective benefit associated with being foreign-born does not extend to those with ambiguous citizenship status, who in our data exhibit attributes similar to the known characteristics of undocumented immigrants.

This issue is explored by comparing acquaintance robberies with the typical robbery involving strangers using NCVS data. The authors find that people who are Black, poor, young, and single are particularly vulnerable to acquaintance robbery.

By using the 2008–2012 area‐identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), we evaluate the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration on individual violence risk across race/ethnicity and labor market stratification factors in areas with different histories of immigration. The results of our analysis reveal three key patterns. First, we find a consistent protective role of immigrant concentration that is not weakened by low education, low income, unemployment, or labor market competition. Therefore, even economically disadvantaged people enjoy the crime‐reduction benefit of immigration. Second, we find support for threshold models that predict a nonlinear, stronger protective role of immigrant concentration on violence at higher levels of immigrant concentration. The protective function of immigration also is higher in areas of longer histories of immigration. Third, compared with Blacks and Whites, Latinos receive a greater violence‐reduction benefit of immigrant concentration possibly because they live in closer proximity with immigrants and share common sociocultural features. Nevertheless, immigrant concentration yields a diminishing return in reducing Latino victimization as immigrants approach a near‐majority of neighborhood residents.

The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23381,"Despite dramatic workforce gains by women in recent decades, a substantial gender earnings gap persists and widens over the course of men's and women's careers.Since there are earnings differences across establishments, a key question is the extent to which the widening of the gender pay gap over time arises from differences in career advances within the same establishment versus differential gains from job-to-job moves across establishments.Using a unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, we find that both channels are important and affect workers differently by education.For the college-educated the increasing gap is for the most part due to differential earnings growth within establishment.The between-establishment component explains only 27 percent of the widening of the total gender pay gap for this group.For workers without college degree, the establishment component is the main driver of the, relatively small, widening of the gender earnings gap.For both education groups, marriage plays a crucial role in the establishment component of the increasing earnings gap.",2017,5/1/2017,27,Erling Barth; Sari Pekkala Kerr; Claudia Olivetti,Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; Forskning.no (Norway); National Bureau of Economic Research; Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College,"Corporate Finance and Governance; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics",,report,Erling Barth,https://openalex.org/A5024342981,Census of Finance Insurance and Real Estate; Annual Retail Trade Survey; Decennial Census,Decennial Census
The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3029846,"We use a unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to analyze how much of the increase in the gender earnings gap over the lifecycle comes from shifts in the sorting of men and women across high- and low-pay establishments and how much is due to differential earnings growth within establishments. We find that for the college educated the increase is substantial and, for the most part, due to differential earnings growth within establishment by gender. The between component is also important. Differential mobility between establishments by gender can explain 27 percent of the widening of the pay gap for this group. For those with no college the relatively small increase of the gender gap over the lifecycle can be fully explained by differential moves by gender across establishments. The evidence suggests that, for both education groups, the between-establishment component of the increasing wage gap is due almost entirely to those who are married.",2017,1/1/2017,25,Erling Barth; Sari Pekkala Kerr; Claudia Olivetti,University of Oslo; Institute for Social Research; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; Charles River Associates; National Bureau of Economic Research; Boston College,"Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Erling Barth,https://openalex.org/A5024342981,Census of Finance Insurance and Real Estate; Annual Retail Trade Survey; Decennial Census,Decennial Census

"Factors associated with attitudes toward U.S. immigration, 2004–2016",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/nkry6,"This study investigates demographic, socioeconomic, political, and contextual factors associated with attitudes toward U.S. immigration. We analyze cross-sectional data from the 2004–2016 General Social Survey and American Community Survey five-year estimates. Results from generalized ordered logit models suggest that support to immigration has been increasing over time. There is no difference by sex on attitudes toward immigration. Non-whites, those between 18 and 24 years of age, people with higher educational attainment, and non-Protestants are more likely to be pro-immigration. People working on sales, office, natural resources, construction, maintenance, production, transportation, material moving, and military occupations are less likely to support immigration. People living in the South Atlantic region are the least likely to support an increase in immigration. People who lived in areas at the age of 16 that tend to have higher proportions of foreign-born individuals are more likely to support immigration. People who self-classify as strong Democrats, Independents near Democrats, and in other parties are more likely to be in favor of an increase on the number of immigrants. People with more liberal political views are more likely to be in favor of immigration. People with lower levels of racial resentment have higher chances to be in favor of an increase in immigration. Opinion about immigration has stronger associations with racial resentment than with opinion about U.S. economic achievement. People who live in counties with higher proportions of college graduates and higher proportions of immigrants are more likely to be pro-immigration.",2018,8/8/2018,2,Ernesto F. L.

"Novel Healthcare Model, Continuation of Inequality: Exploring the Role of Micro Hospitals in Texas Healthcare Access Through Demographic Spatial Modeling",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ev6r2,"Purpose: Micro hospitals are a new form of for-profit healthcare facility with rapid expansion in some parts of the country. They continue to grow in Texas without in-depth public understanding or explicit policy guidance on their role in the healthcare system. Our project aims to define socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of areas served by micro and regular hospitals, and by doing so assess micro hospitals’ impact in expanding healthcare access for disadvantaged populations in Texas.Methodology/Approach: We 1) estimated hospital service areas (catchment areas) with a spatial model based on advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) methods using a proprietary ESRI traffic network; 2) assigned population socioeconomic measures to the catchment areas from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, weighted with an empirically tested Gaussian distribution; 3) used two-tailed t-tests to compare means of population characteristics between micro and regular hospital catchment areas, and 4) conducted logistic regressions to examine relationships between selected population variables and the associated odds of micro hospital presence.Findings: We found micro hospitals in Texas tend to serve a population less stressed in healthcare access compared to those who are more in need as measured by various dimensions of disadvantages.Research Limitations/Implications: Our analysis takes a cross sectional look at the population characteristics of micro hospital service areas. Even though the initial geographic choices of micro hospitals may not reflect the long-term population changes in specific neighborhoods, our analysis can provide policy makers a tool to examine healthcare access for disadvantaged populations at given point in time. As the population socioeconomic characteristics have long been associated with healthcare inequality, we hope our analysis will help foster structural policy considerations that balance growing healthcare delivery innovations and their social accountability.Originality/Value of Paper: We used GIS based spatial modeling to dynamically capture the potential patient basis by travel time calculated with a street network dataset rather than using the traditional static census tract to define hospital service areas. By mapping these boundaries in space we illustrated patterns that regression alone might not. Most importantly, by integrating both spatial and nonspatial dimensions of healthcare access, we demonstrated that the policy considerations on the implications of equal opportunity for healthcare access need to take into account the social realities for those experiencing the most vulnerability in our society, rather than a conceptual “equality” existing in the spatial and market abstraction.",2022,9/15/2022,0,Jingqiu Ren; Ryan Earl; Ernesto F.

Community Banks and Loans for Nonmetropolitan Businesses: A Multilevel Analysis from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12182,"Abstract Access to financial capital is vital for the sustainability of the local business sector in nonmetropolitan communities. In this article we develop two hypotheses and examine the impact of financial sector restructuring on the odds of using a bank loan to finance a new business or expand an existing business. Focusing on nonmetropolitan American businesses, we connect restricted tabulations of the 2007 Survey of Business Owners to data on the commuting zones (CZ) in which businesses are located. We use multilevel logistic regression models to predict the effects of community bank presence within the CZ on the odds of using a bank business loan to start or expand a business for nonmetropolitan businesses started or purchased since 2000. Net of important characteristics of the businesses and owners, we find that the greater the proportion of local banks in a nonmetropolitan CZ, the greater the odds that a conventional business loan was used to either help start a new business or expand an existing business.",2017,7/28/2017,5,F.

Restructuring of the Financial Industry and Implications for Sources of Start-Up Capital for New Businesses in Nonmetropolitan Counties *,,"Historically, in small towns throughout rural America local banks had formed symbiotic relationships with local businesses. The flow of capital was lubricated by the personal relationships and trust that developed between local banks and business owners. However, over the past 20 years changes in interstate banking laws have led to a flurry of mergers and acquisitions resulting in a national consolidation of bank firms.1 This consolidation was followed by a proliferation of establishments at the local level, many of which were former independent and regional banks that serviced local businesses (Boot 2011; Devaney and Weber 1995; Berger and Udell 1995; Berger and Black 2007). Issues affecting the sources of financing are of interest to rural sociologists (Green 1984; 1986). At the core of research on civic community and socioeconomic well-being in rural communities is a strong, independent middle class consisting of local leaders, entrepreneurs, and local small business owners (Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998; Blanchard, Tolbert and Mencken 2012; Tolbert et al. 2002). Entrepreneurs need start-up capital to launch a new business. Likewise, current local business owners need access to capital to keep their businesses functioning, and to expand their operations (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Jarmin 2008; Black and Strahan 2002).In this research note we provide descriptive analyses of sources of financing for new business start-ups in nonmetropolitan counties using data from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO). We present data on the sources of start-up capital for new business in nonmetropolitan counties and propose that there is a distinct decline in the use of bank loans over the decades. We also document a potential increase in use of riskier alternative sources, including credit cards over the past 30 years. Our analysis is unique in that we use confidential tabulations of the 2007 SBO at the Census Research Data Center to compare nonmetropolitan businesses with metropolitan businesses and publically available national trends.2At issue are the implications of changes in banking laws, such as the 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act, beyond merger and acquisitions, and improvements in communications technology (Whaling 1996; Cetorelli and Strahan 2006), that have led to firm-level consolidation in traditional financial services industry over the last 30 years. While many believe that this has increased access to customers and capital for some, there are potentially significant implications for businesses started by local entrepreneurs (De Young, Glennon, and Nigro 2008; Kilkenny 2002; Shaffer and Collender 2008).BACKGROUNDThe banking industry has been one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Before 1994, local banks were protected against interstate and intrastate competition, as state legislatures decided which banks could establish branches and subsidiaries within the state. At the federal level, the banking industry was governed by two important pieces of legislation: the McFadden Act of 1927 and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act. These laws put severe restrictions on interstate banking, and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act required that all bank holding companies (BHCs) fall under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Omarova and Tahyar 2011).3 The 1956 legislation was intended to limit the spatial expansion of large banking groups and their monopolization of local credit markets. However, many BHCs managed to circumvent the interstate restrictions. In 1993, 42 states still prohibited interstate banking, but there was considerable interstate banking activity, just done extremely inefficiently (Nippani and Green 2002; Zou, Miller and Malamud 2011).The 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act sought to remove the inefficiencies and ease the interstate banking restrictions. The impact was argued to be beneficial for banks, businesses, and consumers. …",2016,1/1/2016,7,F. Carson Mencken; Charles M.

Measuring the Flow-Down of Injury Risks Along the Subcontracting Chain in the U.S. Construction Industry,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4844585,"Construction workers experience high rates of injury relative to other occupations. Previous research based on case/interview studies at the level of a craft or establishment and the statistical analysis of injuries across regions finds that subcontracting raises injury rates. This study is the first to combine establishment-level information from the Census Bureau's Economic Census of Construction Industries with data on workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. With these data, we assess how a contractor's position on the subcontracting chain and other establishment characteristics are associated with the number and likelihood of injuries on the job. Findings indicate that as work flows down subcontracting chains, that work is associated with higher rates of injury. Up-chain contractors can choose what scope of work they will keep on a project and what they will offload. This choice is the product of many considerations, one of which may be to disproportionately offload safety risks to lower-tier contractors.",2024,1/1/2024,0,Kevin Conner; Frederick Purifoy; Kevin Duncan; Peter Philips; Mark J.

Modeling plant-level industrial energy demand with the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) database and the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD),https://doi.org/10.2172/10168855,"This report discusses Phase 1 of a project to help the US Department of Energy determine the applicability of the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) database and the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for industrial modeling and analysis. Research was conducted at the US Bureau of the Census; disclosure of the MECS/LRD data used as a basis for this report was subject to the Bureau`s confidentiality restriction. The project is designed to examine the plant-level energy behavior of energy-intensive industries. In Phase 1, six industries at the four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) level were studied. The utility of analyzing four-digit SIC samples at the plant level is mixed, but the plant-level structure of the MECS/LRD makes analyzing samples disaggregated below the four-digit level feasible, particularly when the MECS/LRD data are combined with trade association or other external data. When external data are used, the validity of using value of shipments as a measure of output for analyzing energy use can also be examined. Phase 1 results indicate that technical efficiency and the distribution of energy intensities vary significantly at the plant level. They also show that the six industries exhibit monopsony-like behavior; that is, energy prices vary significantly at the plant level, with lower prices being correlated with a higher level of energy consumption. Finally, they show to what degree selected energy-intensive products are manufactured outside their primary industry.",1992,8/1/1992,6,Gale Boyd; M.J.

Preliminary Analysis of the Distributions of Carbon and Energy Intensity for 27 Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industrial Sectors,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1925133,"It is well documented that different manufacturing sectors require different amounts of energy. Primary materials conversion, e.g., iron ore and scrap into steel, limestone and sand into cement and glass, or wood and other fibers into paper, tend to be the most energy-intensive in the production process, while final consumer products like electronics and clothing require the least energy. This leads to something like the 80-20 rule, where a large portion of energy use is in a small number of industries. For example, the 2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) reported that 75 percent of fuel use arises from only five of the 21 three-digit industries, using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These five sectors are a small share of the total U.S. economy. The energy intensity for different industrial sectors is easily measured using published government statistics, but the plants within these industries are not homogeneous entities. This report measures the differences in energy use and associated CO2 emissions as a first step to understanding the within-sector heterogeneity of energy use.",2011,1/1/2011,1,Gale Boyd; Tatyana Kuzmenko; Béla Személy; Gang Zhang,Duke University; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Boston University; Quest University Canada,"Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies; Vehicle emissions and performance",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Gale A Boyd,https://openalex.org/A5058981904,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200; Census of Retail Trade; Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey; Census of Mining,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey
File Matching with Faulty Continuous Matching Variables,,"We present LFCMV, a Bayesian file linking methodology designed to link records using continuous matching variables in situations where we do not expect values of these matching variables to agree exactly across matched pairs. The method involves a linking model for the distance between the matching variables of records in one file and the matching variables of their linked records in the second. This linking model is conditional on a vector indicating the links. We specify a mixture model for the distance component of the linking model, as this latent structure allows the distance between matching variables in linked pairs to vary across types of linked pairs. Finally, we specify a model for the linking vector. We describe the Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of this linkage model and use artificial data to illustrate model performance.

Cohabitation and Marriage Among Same-Sex Couples in the 2019 ACS and CPS: A Research Note,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-10181474,"Abstract Since the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that marriages of same-sex couples are legal in all states in the union, federal surveys have adapted to the shifting legal climate and included new measures that more directly identify same-sex and different-sex cohabiting and married couples. In this research note comparing the largest and most recent federal surveys—the 2019 American Community Survey and Current Population Survey—we find consistent levels of cohabitation and marriage across surveys. While the vast majority (90%) of different-sex couples were married, we report a more even split in cohabitation and marriage among same-sex couples. Our evaluation of sociodemographic characteristics of married and cohabiting couples indicates that differences were less prominent among same-sex couples than among different-sex couples, suggesting weaker sociodemographic selection into marriage among the former. However, factors affecting same-sex and different-sex couples' decisions to live together and marry may differ because of legal and social climates that still present unique obstacles for same-sex couples. Researchers need to acknowledge these differences in assessments of the implications of marriage for health and well-being.",2022,9/19/2022,10,Wendy D. Manning; Krista K. Payne; Gary J.

We use temporal and geographic variation in the introduction of Secure Communities (SC), a county-based immigration enforcement policy, combined with data over 2005-2014 from the American Community Survey to estimate a difference-in-difference model with geographic and time fixed effects. We find evidence that SC had a negative impact on the employment of low-skilled non-citizen workers, who are likely to be directly affected by the policy. Importantly, we also find that SC negatively impacted the employment of citizens working in middle to high-skill occupations.

"Within-Couple Age Differences and Marital Sorting: Earnings, Ability and Appearance",,"This paper analyses how individual characteristics vary with within-couple age differences. Earnings analysis of prime-aged married couples in the 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses finds that male earnings decrease with within-couple age difference while female earnings increase with within-couple age difference. These patterns are true both for marriages in which the man is older and in which the woman is older. They are also robust across all four Census years. As an explanation for these patterns, we suggest that individuals typically prefer similarly aged spouses. Individuals who search and match outside similarly-aged partners therefore tend to be negatively selected. Women in differently-aged couples have higher earnings not because of positive selection, but because their effort increases in response to partnering with a lower earning man. We test whether there is negative selection into differently-aged couples using three measures: average earnings per hour in occupation using Census data, cognitive skills assessments from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79), and measures of physical appearance from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).

A Comparison of Firm Age in the Survey of Business Owners and the Longitudinal Business Database,,"In this note, we use restricted-access data from the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) and the 2002 and 2007 Surveys of Business Owners (SBO) that are linked to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and compare how firm age is reported across sources. Our analysis shows considerable agreement between administrative and survey measures. However, we also find meaningful discrepancies. The SBO measures generally suggest an earlier date of founding than is revealed in the LBD.

On the U.S. Firm and Establishment Size Distributions,https://doi.org/10.17016/feds.2018.075,"This paper revisits the empirical evidence on the nature of firm and establishment size distributions in the United States using the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), a confidential Census Bureau panel of all non-farm private firms and establishments with at least one employee. We establish five stylized facts that are relevant for the extent of granularity and the nature of growth in the U.S. economy: (1) with an estimated shape parameter significantly below 1, the best-fitting Pareto distribution substantially differs from Zipf's law for both firms and establishments; (2) a lognormal distribution fits both establishment and firm size distributions better than the commonly-used Pareto distribution, even far in the upper tail; (3) a convolution of lognormal and Pareto distributions fits both size distributions better than lognormal alone while also providing a better fit for the employment share distribution; (4) the estimated parameters are different across manufa cturing and services sectors, but the distribution fit ranking remains unchanged in the sectoral subsamples. Finally, using the Census of Manufactures (CM), we find that (5) the distribution of establishment-level total factor productivity---a common theoretical primitive for size---is also better described by lognormal than Pareto.

Regional Analysis Using Census Bureau Microdata at the Center for Economic Studies,https://doi.org/10.1177/0160017606289898,"Regional science research requires data sets with detailed geography. Dissemination of data sets with sufficient geographic specificity challenges statistical agencies in terms of protecting respondent privacy. The U.S. Census Bureau first released decennial census microdata in the 1960s. Today, public versions of largely demographic surveys enjoy widespread use but limit the geographic detail of individual observations. With business data, firm and establishment distributions are highly skewed, preventing release of public use microdata versions. To support its own statistical programs by giving external researchers access to internal versions of public use data files, the Census Bureau created the Center for Economic Studies (CES) and a national network of Research Data Centers (RDCs). This model permits researchers access to confidential economic and demographic data under secure, controlled conditions.

Rural America at a glance,https://doi.org/10.32747/2023.8134362.ers,"The U.S. rural population is growing again after a decade of overall population loss, with growth of approximately a quarter percent from 2020 to 2022. This growth occurred because rural in-migration was larger than declines in the natural rate (the number of births compared with the number of deaths) of population growth. The rural population is also experiencing declines in poverty. In 2021, 9.7 percent fewer nonmetropolitan counties experienced persistent poverty (20 percent or more of the population had poverty level household incomes in each of the last four decennial Census years) compared with a decade earlier. Still, more than half of extremely low-income nonmetropolitan renter households experienced housing insecurity. This issue was particularly acute for American Indian or Alaska Native and Hispanic households. This report examines recent issues such as rural population and migration trends, poverty, housing insecurity, employment, and clean energy jobs. The report finds that rural employment levels and annual growth rates nearly returned to those seen in the years prior to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Unbundling of Advertising Agency Services: An Economic Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1515/1546-5616.1164,"Abstract We address a puzzle surrounding the shift from bundling to unbundling of U.S. advertising agency services and the slow pace of change over several decades. We model an agency’s decision as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing a relationship with an agency and pecuniary economies of scale from media services provision. Using micro-data from the U.S. Census of Services for 1982-2007, we find agencies are more likely to unbundle with increasing size, diversification and higher media prices, and less likely with increasing age, larger media volume, and an interaction between media prices and volume.",2012,12/3/2012,8,Mohammad Arzaghi; Ernst R.

Citizenship Reporting in the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.29.1,"Citizenship status among the foreign born is a crucial indicator of social and political incorporation, yet there are good reasons to suspect that citizenship status is inaccurately reported on U.S. surveys.This paper updates research carried out in the mid-1990s by Passel and Clark (1997) on the extent to which foreign-born non-citizen respondents in U.S. government-sponsored surveys misreport as naturalized citizens.We compare demographic estimates of the resident naturalized foreign-born population in 2010, based on administrative data, to estimates from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS).Similar to previous research, we find that misreporting in the ACS is especially high among immigrants from all countries/regions who report fewer than five years in the U.S. We also find that among longer-term foreign-born residents, misreporting is concentrated only among those originating in Mexico, especially men, a finding that diverges from Passel and Clark in that we find no evidence of over-reporting among immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.",2013,7/2/2013,31,Jennifer Van Hook; James D.

Estimating the Characteristics of Unauthorized Immigrants Using U.S. Census Data: Combined Sample Multiple Imputation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716218767383,"Contemporary U.S. immigration policy debates would be better informed by more accurate data about how many unauthorized immigrants reside in the country, where they reside, and the conditions in which they live. Researchers use demographic methods to generate aggregated information about the number and demographic composition of the unauthorized immigrant population. But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

Using estimates of undocumented immigrants to study the immigration-crime relationship,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648x.2020.1819375,"The debate about undocumented immigration and its potential relation to crime continues to boil in the United States. We study this relationship by using two sets of estimates for the 2014 undocumented foreign-born population in U.S. metropolitan areas acquired from the Pew Research Center and the Migration Population Institute, 2013-2015 FBI Uniform Crime Report data, and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau, to model the association between undocumented immigration and violent and property crime. Findings are consistent across all estimates of metropolitan undocumented populations. Net of relevant covariates, we find negative effects of undocumented immigration on the overall property crime rate, larceny, and burglary; effects in models using violent crime measures as the outcomes are statistically non-significant. Although the results are based on cross-sectional data, they mirror other research findings that immigration either reduces or has no impact on crime, on average, and contribute to a growing literature on the relationship between immigration and crime.",2020,10/3/2020,10,Robert M.

Leapfrogging the Melting Pot? European Immigrants' Intergenerational Mobility across the Twentieth Century,https://doi.org/10.15195/v8.a23,"During the early twentieth century, industrial-era European immigrants entered the United States with lower levels of education than the U.S. average.

“WHITENESS” IN CONTEXT,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1742058x20000223,"Abstract Using data from the 2008–2016 American Community Survey, we compare the racial identification responses of the Mexican-origin population residing in California to their counterparts in Texas, the two states with the largest and most established Mexican-origin populations. We draw on existing theory and research in order to derive a theoretical account of state-level historical mechanisms that are likely to lead to varying patterns of racial identification within the two states and a set of propositions predicting the nature of this variation. Results indicate that the Mexican-origin population in Texas is substantially more likely to claim White racial identification than their counterparts in California, even after accounting for factors related to racial identity formation. Further analysis indicates that this result is robust and buffets the notion that the historical development of the racial context in Texas has engendered a present-day context in which “Whiteness” carries a distinctive social value, relative to California’s ethnoracial context, and that this social value is reflected in the ways in which individuals of Mexican origin respond to race questions on U.S. Census surveys.",2020,1/1/2020,1,Jorge Ballinas; James D.

State of birth and cardiovascular disease mortality: Multilevel analyses of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100875,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading contributor to mortality in the United States. Previous studies have linked early life individual and family factors, along with various contemporaneous place-based exposures to differential individual CVD mortality risk. However, the impacts of early life place exposures and how they compare to the effects of an individual's current place of residence on CVD mortality risk is not well understood. Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, this research examined the effects of both state of birth and state of residence on individual's risk of CVD mortality. We estimated individual mortality risk by estimating multi-level logistic regression models. We found that during a follow-up period of 11 years, 18,292 (4.2%) out of 433,345 participants died from CVD. The impact of state of birth on subsequent CVD mortality risk are greater than state of residence, even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Individuals who were born in certain states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania on average had higher CVD mortality risk. Conversely, those born in California, North Dakota, and Montana were found to have lower risk, no matter where they presently live. This study implies that early life state-level environments may be more prominent to individual's CVD mortality risk, compared to the state in which one lives. Future research should address specific mechanisms through which state of birth may affect people's risk of CVD mortality.",2021,7/16/2021,8,Wei Xu; Michael Topping; Jason M.

The aim of this study is to assess and compare the importance of state of birth and state of residence in predicting mortality for adults over age 50 in the US. Using nationally representative data of nearly 100,000 adults over age 50 from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, we estimated individual mortality risk using multi-level logistic regression with state of birth and state of residence as second-level random effects. We assessed whether state of residence and state of birth contributed to the variation in adult mortality. We also decomposed state-of-residence random effects to compare ""movers"" and ""stayers."" Our results indicate that state of birth is a stronger predictor of age-, race/ethnicity- and sex-adjusted mortality in the US than state of residence at the time of death. The adult mortality profiles of many states are substantially impacted by the composition of ""movers."" Failing to account for residential mobility has clouded our understanding of the patterns and causes of geographic differences in adult mortality.

Evaluating the Usefulness of the American Housing Survey for Creating House Price Indices,,"The American Housing Survey (AHS) is a valuable source of information on houses and occupants over time. The AHS has several advantages over sales data for use in the creation of price indices: it is readily available, has frequent observations over time and space, has data from the late 1970s through the mid 1990s, includes houses that do not sell, as well as those that do, and has information on the occupants. The drawbacks include: a time lag between the interview and the release of the data, data suppression issues, owner stated house values, and a lack of neighborhood information. In this study we use the metropolitan version of the AHS which has been supplemented with the original survey data as well as Census tract data for three cities over fourteen years to examine whether the AHS can be used to create indices. Indices are estimated using hedonic, repeat valuation, and hybrid techniques, overcoming some of the problems inherent in the estimation of indices. We find that the data suppression issues and the owner stated house values are not problematic. The biggest drawback of the AHS is its lack of objective information on neighborhood quality.",1997,4/25/1997,1,Katherine A.

"Location, Location, Location: The 3L Approach to House Price Determination",,"The immobility of houses means that their location affects their values. This explains the common belief that three things determine the price of a house: location, location, and location. We use this notion to develop the 3L Approach to house price determination. That is, prices are determined by the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), town, and street where the house is located. This study creates a unique data set based on data from the American Housing Survey (AHS) consisting of small ‘clusters’ of housing units with information on their housing characteristics and resident characteristics that is merged with census tract-level attributes. We use this data to verify the 3L Approach: we find that all three levels of location are significant when estimating the house price hedonic equation. This indicates that individuals care about their local neighborhood, i.e. the general upkeep of their street and possibly their neighbors’ characteristics (cluster variables), a broader area such as the school district and/or the town (tract variables) that account for school quality and crime rates, and the particular amenities found in their MSA.",2004,5/1/2004,18,Jeffrey Zabel; Katherine A.

Controlling for Quality in House Price Indices,,"Given the importance of house prices it is not surprising that house price indices are used for many purposes. One of the characteristics that differentiates indices is the level of control for housing quality. It is shown that, regardless of the desired level of quality control, it is necessary to account for all significant determinants of house prices that change over time in order to obtain unbiased estimates of house price indices. An example is presented using data from the American Housing Survey that is merged with census tract level information obtained from the Summary Tape Files of the 1980 and 1990 Decenial Censuses. The results show that not accounting for neighborhood quality can lead to substantial biases in estimates of house price appreciation rates.",1996,1/1/1996,5,Jeffrey Zabel,Tufts University,"Housing Market and Economics; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Jeffrey E Zabel,https://openalex.org/A5032557239,American Housing Survey,American Housing Survey
The Accuracy of Owner-Provided House Values: The 1978-1991 American Housing Survey,,"The American Housing Survey (AHS) includes the owner's valuation of the house as a measure of the house's value. If owner-stated values are accurate, the AHS (as well as other survey instruments) can be used by researchers studying a variety of topics. In this study we use the metropolitan version of the AHS for three cities over fourteen years to compare owners' valuations with sales prices of houses that sold in the twelve months prior to an interview. We find that, on average, recent buyers report house values that are 8.4% higher than the stated sales prices. Further analysis indicates that these recent buyers, when compared with owners with longer tenure, overvalue their houses by 3.3%, on average. Thus, we find that the average owner overvalues his house by 5.1%. Also, differences between sales prices and owners' valuations are not related to particular characteristics of the house, occupants (other than length of tenure), or neighborhood. Thus, the use of the owners' valuations will result in accurate estimates of house price indexes and will provide reliable estimates of the prices of house and neighborhood characteristics.",1999,1/1/1999,0,Katherine A.

Citizenship Reporting in the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.29.1,"Citizenship status among the foreign born is a crucial indicator of social and political incorporation, yet there are good reasons to suspect that citizenship status is inaccurately reported on U.S. surveys.This paper updates research carried out in the mid-1990s by Passel and Clark (1997) on the extent to which foreign-born non-citizen respondents in U.S. government-sponsored surveys misreport as naturalized citizens.We compare demographic estimates of the resident naturalized foreign-born population in 2010, based on administrative data, to estimates from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS).Similar to previous research, we find that misreporting in the ACS is especially high among immigrants from all countries/regions who report fewer than five years in the U.S. We also find that among longer-term foreign-born residents, misreporting is concentrated only among those originating in Mexico, especially men, a finding that diverges from Passel and Clark in that we find no evidence of over-reporting among immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.",2013,7/2/2013,31,Jennifer Van Hook; James D.

(Un)Healthy Immigrant Citizens,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146513504760,"This research argues that immigrants’ political, social, and economic incorporation experiences, which are embedded in individual life course trajectories and heavily influenced by governmental policies, play an important role in producing diverse health outcomes among older U.S. foreign-born persons. Using data from the 2008–2010 American Community Survey and 1998–2010 Integrated Health Interview Series, we demonstrate how naturalization, a key indicator of social and political inclusion, is related to functional health in midlife and older age. Consistent with the theoretical framework, we find that among those foreign-born who immigrated as children and young adults, naturalized citizens show better health at older ages compared with noncitizens, although this relationship is partly mediated by education. But among those older foreign-born who immigrated at middle and older ages, naturalized citizens report worse health compared with noncitizens. Moreover, this negative health selection into naturalization becomes stronger for those naturalizing after the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.",2013,12/1/2013,72,Zoya Gubernskaya; Frank D.

Researchers use demographic methods to generate aggregated information about the number and demographic composition of the unauthorized immigrant population. But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

We use the cohort component method to estimate population size across different migration scenarios and distinguish between aging in place and new immigration. We also examine contemporary health insurance coverage and chronic health conditions among 55 and older undocumented Latinos from the 2003-2014 California Health Interview Survey. We then project health insurance rates in 2038 among Latino immigrants under different migration and policy scenarios.If current mortality, migration, and policy trends continue, projections estimate that 40% of undocumented Latino immigrants will be 55 years or older by 2038-nearly all of whom will have aged in place. Currently, 40% of older Latino undocumented immigrants do not have insurance. Without policies that increase access to insurance, projections estimate that the share who are uninsured among all older Latinos immigrants will rise from 15% to 21%, and the share who is both uninsured and living with a chronic health condition will rise from 5% to 9%.Without access to health care, older undocumented immigrants may experience delayed care and more severe morbidity.

Beyond Stocks and Surges: The Demographic Impact of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1111/padr.12683,"Abstract Stock estimates of the US unauthorized foreign‐born population are routinely published, but less is known about this population's dynamics. Using a series of residual estimates based on 2000 Census and 2001–2022 American Community Survey (ACS), I estimate the components of change for the unauthorized immigrant population from 2000 to 2022 by region and country of origin. Further, I develop and present novel measures of expected duration in unauthorized status and demographic impact of unauthorized entries (i.e., person‐years lived in unauthorized status). Results reveal dramatic changes over the last two decades. In the early 2000s, the unauthorized immigrant population was dominated by Mexicans who tended to remain in the United States for extended periods of time and whose demographic impact on the US population was substantial. After the 2007–2008 Great Recession, a new pattern emerged. Unauthorized migrants now arrive from across the globe, including Central America and Asia (up through 2018), and most recently from Europe, Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and other parts of South America. These new unauthorized immigrants are more likely to arrive on temporary nonimmigrant visas (which typically allow a foreigner to live and work in the United States for six years) and, with the exception of Venezuelans, spend less time in unauthorized status. Overall, the demographic impact of this new type of unauthorized migration is lower than it was two decades ago.",2024,10/28/2024,2,Jennifer Van Hook,Pennsylvania State University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Population and Development Review,article,Jennifer L Van Hook,https://openalex.org/A5052990364,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS); American Community Survey; Current Population Survey March Supplement,American Community Survey

Premium Growth between 1997 and 2004 and its Effect on Employer-Sponsored Insurance,,"While economic theory predicts that workers bear the cost of rising health insurance premiums with reductions in wages and/or other benefits, empirical evidence on the existence of a wage-health insurance tradeoff has been mixed. Empirical analyses have been hampered by the fact that individuals with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) are usually more skilled and have higher wages than those without insurance. For instance, a simple regression of wages on the presence of health insurance typically leads to a positive, rather than a negative relationship. Several recent studies have used difference-in-differences strategies to explore this topic across geographic areas with differing health care costs or inflation rates. For instance, Sheiner (1999) finds evidence that age-wage profiles are flattest in high-health cost areas, reflecting the incidence of health costs on workers' wages. Sommers (2005) finds evidence that when employers are faced with rising premiums, the increased insurance costs can be better absorbed through wage adjustments in areas with high general inflation or by high wage workers. Both of these studies analyzed household level survey data. We extend this literature using employer level data from the 1999-2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC), a large, nationally representative survey of employers and their health insurance plans. We also extend prior work in that we use difference-in-differences strategies to examine the effect of high premium growth on a wider set of health insurance outcomes: the likelihood that an employer will offer insurance, the levels of employee premium contributions and the generosity of benefits. Our strategies involve comparing areas with varying levels of premium growth, general inflation and employers with different wage distributions. To form premium-specific inflation measures, we predict values from a hedonic regression of MEPS-IC premiums on various MSA-level measures of health care costs as well as plan type and benefits. MSA-level predictions are then formed by fixing plan type and benefits, so that the only source of variation is health care costs. To identify areas with varying levels of inflation, we combine the MEPS-IC data with the CPI for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (which provides MSA-specific inflation rates over time). The MEPS-IC data are arguably better suited for studying many aspects of the ESI market than are widely-used household data sources such as the CPS or the MEPS-Household Component and provides a rich data resource for exploring a wide range of hypotheses regarding the impact of premium growth on the presence and generosity of ESI offers.",2007,6/1/2007,0,Thomas M.

"Novel Healthcare Model, Continuation of Inequality: Exploring the Role of Micro Hospitals in Texas Healthcare Access Through Demographic Spatial Modeling",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ev6r2,"Purpose: Micro hospitals are a new form of for-profit healthcare facility with rapid expansion in some parts of the country. They continue to grow in Texas without in-depth public understanding or explicit policy guidance on their role in the healthcare system. Our project aims to define socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of areas served by micro and regular hospitals, and by doing so assess micro hospitals’ impact in expanding healthcare access for disadvantaged populations in Texas.Methodology/Approach: We 1) estimated hospital service areas (catchment areas) with a spatial model based on advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) methods using a proprietary ESRI traffic network; 2) assigned population socioeconomic measures to the catchment areas from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, weighted with an empirically tested Gaussian distribution; 3) used two-tailed t-tests to compare means of population characteristics between micro and regular hospital catchment areas, and 4) conducted logistic regressions to examine relationships between selected population variables and the associated odds of micro hospital presence.Findings: We found micro hospitals in Texas tend to serve a population less stressed in healthcare access compared to those who are more in need as measured by various dimensions of disadvantages.Research Limitations/Implications: Our analysis takes a cross sectional look at the population characteristics of micro hospital service areas. Even though the initial geographic choices of micro hospitals may not reflect the long-term population changes in specific neighborhoods, our analysis can provide policy makers a tool to examine healthcare access for disadvantaged populations at given point in time. As the population socioeconomic characteristics have long been associated with healthcare inequality, we hope our analysis will help foster structural policy considerations that balance growing healthcare delivery innovations and their social accountability.Originality/Value of Paper: We used GIS based spatial modeling to dynamically capture the potential patient basis by travel time calculated with a street network dataset rather than using the traditional static census tract to define hospital service areas. By mapping these boundaries in space we illustrated patterns that regression alone might not. Most importantly, by integrating both spatial and nonspatial dimensions of healthcare access, we demonstrated that the policy considerations on the implications of equal opportunity for healthcare access need to take into account the social realities for those experiencing the most vulnerability in our society, rather than a conceptual “equality” existing in the spatial and market abstraction.",2022,9/15/2022,0,Jingqiu Ren; Ryan Earl; Ernesto F.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,1/1/2022,51,Daron Acemoğlu; Gary Clayton Anderson; David N.

Measuring the Dynamics of Young and Small Businesses,https://doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226172576.003.0010,"Abstract This chapter presents an attempt to measure producer dynamics for the business population. The analysis concentrates on forty industries for which smaller and younger businesses play especially important roles. The data reveals that fluctuations in nonemployer size, measured in terms of revenue, from year to year are much larger for nonemployer firms than employer firms. But as nonemployer firms age and grow, the volatility of their revenue stream declines. Migrants are on a trajectory of rapid growth before and during the transition to employer status. In addition, migrants from the nonemployer universe account for a sizable share of young employers in the industries studied. The Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD) makes it possible to explore the behavior over time of virtually all businesses in the U.S. economy, employers and nonemployers alike, with robust samples and even entire populations.",2009,1/1/2009,19,Steven J.

Gross Job Flows for the U.S. Manufacturing Sector: Measurement from the Longitudinal Research Database,,"Measures of job creation and destruction are now produced regularly by the U.S. statistical agencies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases via the Business Employment Dynamics (BED) on a quarterly basis measures of job creation and destruction for the U.S. nonfarm business sector and related disaggregation by industrial sector and size class. The U.S. Census Bureau has developed the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) covering the nonfarm business sector that has been used to produce research analysis and special tabulations including tabulations of job creation and destruction. Both of these data programs build upon the measurement methods and data analysis of job creation and destruction measures from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) developed and published by Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996). In this paper, the LRD based estimates of job creation and destruction are updated and made available for consistent annual and quarterly series from 1972-1998. While the BED and LBD programs are more comprehensive in scope than the LRD, the extensive development of the LRD permits the construction of measures of job creation and destruction for a rich array of employer characteristics including industry, size, business age, ownership structure, location and wage structure. The updated series that are released with this working paper provide measures along each of these dimensions. The paper describes in detail the changes in the processing of the Annual Survey of Manufactures over the 1972-1998 period that are important to incorporate by users of the LRD at Census Research Data Centers as well as users of products from the LRD such as job creation and destruction.",2006,12/1/2006,20,Lucia Foster; John Haltiwanger; Namsuk Kim,"University of Maryland, College Park",Firm Innovation and Growth; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Economic Growth and Productivity,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,John C Haltiwanger,https://openalex.org/A5010043276,Census of Manufactures; Annual Survey of Manufactures; Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),Annual Survey of Manufactures
Published Versus Sample Statistics From The ASM: Implications For The LRD,,"In principle, the Longitudinal Research Database ( LRD ) which links the establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) is ideal for examining the dynamics of firm and aggregate behavior. However, the published ASM aggregates are not simply the appropriately weighted sums of establishment data in the LRD . Instead, the published data equal the sum of LRD-based sample estimates and nonsample estimates. The latter reflect adjustments related to sampling error and the imputation of small-establishment data. Differences between the LRD and the ASM raise questions for users of both data sets. For ASM users, time-series variation in the difference indicates potential problems in consistently and reliably estimating the nonsample portion of the ASM. For LRD users, potential sample selection problems arise due to the systematic exclusion of data from small establishments. Microeconomic studies based on the LRD can yield misleading inferences to the extent that small establishments behave differently. Similarly, new economic aggregates constructed from the LRD can yield incorrect estimates of levels and growth rates. This paper documents cross-sectional and time-series differences between ASM and LRD estimates of levels and growth rates of total employment, and compares them with employment estimates provided by Bureau of Labor Statistics and County Business Patterns data. In addition, this paper explores potential adjustments to economic aggregates constructed from the LRD. In particular, the paper reports the results of adjusting LRD-based estimates of gross job creation and destruction to be consistent with net job changes implied by the published ASM figures.",1991,1/1/1991,18,John Haltiwanger; Steven J.

Interpolating U.S. Decennial Census Tract Data from as Early as 1970 to 2010: A Longitudinal Tract Database,https://doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2014.905156,"Differences in the reporting units of data from diverse sources and changes in units over time are common obstacles to analysis of areal data. We compare common approaches to this problem in the context of changes over time in the boundaries of U.S. census tracts. In every decennial census many tracts are split, consolidated, or changed in other ways from the previous boundaries to reflect population growth or decline. We examine two interpolation methods to create a bridge between years, one that relies only on areal weighting and another that also introduces population weights. Results demonstrate that these approaches produce substantially different estimates for variables that involve population counts, but they have a high degree of convergence for variables defined as rates or averages. Finally the paper describes the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), through which we are making available public-use tools to implement these methods to create estimates within 2010 tract boundaries for any tract-level data (from the census or other sources) that are available for prior years as early as 1970.",2014,5/13/2014,405,John Logan; Zengwang Xu; Brian J.

Models for Small Area Estimation for Census Tracts,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12215,"This study examines issues of Small Area Estimation that are raised by reliance on the American Community Survey (ACS), which reports tract‐level data based on much smaller samples than the decennial census long‐form that it replaced. We demonstrate the problem using a 100% transcription of microdata from the 1940 census. By drawing many samples from two major cities, we confirm a known pattern: random samples yield unbiased point estimates of means or proportions, but estimates based on smaller samples have larger average errors in measurement and greater risk of large error. Sampling variability also inflates estimates of measures of variation across areas (reflecting segregation or spatial inequality). This variation is at the heart of much contemporary spatial analysis. We then evaluate possible solutions. For point estimates, we examine three Bayesian models, all of which reduce sampling variation, and we encourage use of such models to correct ACS small area estimates. However, the corrected estimates cannot be used to calculate estimates of variation, because smoothing toward local or grand means artificially reduces variation. We note that there are potential Bayesian approaches to this problem, and we demonstrate an efficacious alternative that uses the original sample data.",2019,7/10/2019,8,John Logan; Cici Bauer; Jun Ke; Hongwei Xu; Fan Li,"Brown University; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Brown University; Queens College, CUNY; Yale University",Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Housing Market and Economics,Geographical Analysis,article,John R Logan,https://openalex.org/A5048869586,American Community Survey; Address Control FIle; Decennial Census; Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,American Community Survey; Decennial Census

STATE MERIT‐BASED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND COLLEGE ATTAINMENT,https://doi.org/10.1111/jors.12161,ABSTRACT This paper examines the effects of state merit‐based student aid programs on college attendance and degree completion. Our primary analysis uses microdata from the 2000 United States Census and 2001–2010 American Community Survey to estimate the effects of exposure to merit programs on educational outcomes for 25 states that adopted such programs by 2004. We also utilize administrative data for the University System of Georgia to look more in depth at the effects of exposure to the HOPE Scholarship on degree completion. We find strong consistent evidence that exposure to state merit aid programs have no meaningfully positive effect on college completion.,2014,9/24/2014,97,David L. Sjoquist; John V.

An Anatomy Of Racial and Ethnic Trends in Male Earnings in the U.S,https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12064,"Progress in narrowing black–white earnings differences has been far from continuous, with some of the apparent progress resulting from labor force withdrawal among lower‐skilled A frican A mericans.

Emphasis is given to annual rather than weekly or hourly earnings. We take a quantile approach, providing evidence on medians and other percentiles of the distribution. Treatment of imputed earnings greatly affects measured outcomes. Hispanic men have exhibited earnings growth similar to white men over several decades. Black men have been left behind economically due in large part to increased joblessness, a process exacerbated by weak labor market conditions.

The preferred IV results yield an average point estimate for the production‐stock relationship of 0.52, but the effect likely decreases with age. Los graduados universitarios son importantes para las economías regionales, pero también son bastante móviles geográficamente. Este artículo examina la relación entre los índices de graduación universitaria entre las personas de un estado (producción relativa) y la proporción posterior de graduados universitarios para las personas que residen en el estado (existencias relativas), mediante el uso del censo decenal y microdatos de la Encuesta de la Comunidad Estadounidense. La relación descriptiva ha aumentado en el tiempo y es casi proporcional en los últimos años. Se utilizan métodos de variables instrumentales (VI) para estimar los efectos causales. Los resultados de las IV preferidas arrojan una estimación de punto promedio para el cociente producción‐existencias de 0,52, pero es probable que el efecto disminuya con la edad. 大学卒業者は、地域経済にとって貴重であるが、地理的な移動可能性が非常に高くもある。本稿では、国勢調査とAmerican Community Surveyのマイクロデータを使用して、ある州の出身者の大学卒業率(相対的生産)とその後のその州の居住者の大学卒業率(相対的在庫)の関連性を検討する。経時的に記述的関連性は増加しており、近年ではほぼ均衡的である。操作変数法を用いて因果効果を推計する。好ましい操作変数の結果は、生産と在庫の関係性に対する推算の平均で0.52となったが、年齢とともに効果は減少する傾向がある。",2016,10/7/2016,9,John V.

"Stem Graduates, Human Capital Externalities, and Wages in the U.S.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2372539,"Previous research suggests that the local stock of human capital creates positive externalities within local labor markets and plays an important role in regional economic development. However, there is still considerable uncertainty over what types of human capital are most important. Both national and local policymakers in the U.S. have called for efforts to increase the stock of college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, but data availability has thus far prevented researchers from directly connecting STEM education to human capital externalities. This paper uses the 2009-2011 American Community Survey to examine the external effects of college graduates in STEM and non-STEM fields on the wages of other workers in the same metropolitan area. I find that both types of college graduates create positive wage externalities, but STEM graduates create much larger externalities.",2013,1/1/2013,13,John V.

We find high persistence in the state rankings of nominal public school teacher salaries across time. Yet, we also find that the rankings significantly shift with the adjustments, suggesting they are necessary for meaningful comparisons of public teacher salaries across states. The differences in teacher pay across states also greatly narrow with the adjustments. Finally, this is the first study to show and test that teacher salary comparisons across states should be based on a comparison of public school teacher salaries with nonteacher college graduates in the states, adjusted for differences in personal characteristics and effective federal tax rates.",2017,6/20/2017,6,Dan S.

State Merit-Aid Programs and College Major: A Focus on STEM,,"Since 1991 more than two dozen states have adopted merit-based student financial aid programs, intended at least in part to increase the stock of human capital by improving the knowledge and skills of the state's workforce. At the same time, there has been growing concern that the U.S. is producing too few college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Using both microdata from the American Community Survey and student records from the University System of Georgia, this paper examines whether recently adopted state merit-aid programs have affected college major decisions, with a focus on STEM fields.

High wages in STEM paid-employment combined with reduced earnings in self-employment make self-employment less desirable for STEM graduates.

Self-Employment Differentials among Foreign-Born STEM and Non-STEM Workers,,"This paper uses the American Community Survey to examine the previously overlooked fact that foreign STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduates have much lower self-employment rates than their non-STEM counterparts, with an unconditional difference of 3.3 percentage points. We find empirical support for differing earnings opportunities as a partial explanation for this self-employment gap. High wages in STEM paid-employment combined with reduced earnings in self-employment make self-employment less desirable for STEM graduates. High self-employment rates among other foreign-born workers partially reflect weak paid-employment opportunities.

Trends in Minority Commuting Behavior: What Does the American Community Survey Tell Us?,,"Two currently important aspects of transportation research are addressed in this paper, the changing nature of travel behavior among the growing minority groups and the potential utility of the American Community Survey (ACS) as an emerging source of travel information. With minority groups growing in population (the Chicago metropolitan area is projected to be more than half ‘minority’ by 2030), the commuting patterns and trends of this population need close examination. We find that, overall, minorities have higher travel times to work, but in suburban Chicago they have lower travel times. We now have sufficient data in the ACS to make this assessment and address some of the key questions regarding commuting behavior. We find that the ACS data for Illinois, from 2000 to 2003, reveals only a few short-term trends, such as growing minority populations and increasing tendency to drive to work, but that the travel times and mode use have not changed substantially throughout the study period, 2000-2003. These findings support the intent of the US Census Bureau to aggregate several years of data, at increased sample sizes, so that researchers and planners alike may study patterns and trend at small levels of geographic detail. At the same time, caution needs to be exercised in analyzing aggregate data for variables that exhibit change over time. The key here is the change over short periods of time, five years, rather than long-term changes that are common in travel behavior.",2006,1/1/2006,0,S Sööt; Joost Gideon Berman,,"Urban Transport and Accessibility; Transportation Planning and Optimization; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Transportation Research Board 85th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,article,Joost G Berman,https://openalex.org/A5057071957,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; American Community Survey,American Community Survey
Immigrant Legal Status among Essential Frontline Workers in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183221127277,"Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has extracted a substantial toll on immigrant communities in the United States, due in part to increased potential risk of exposure for immigrants to COVID-19 in the workplace. In this article, we use federal guidance on which industries in the United States were designated essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, information about the ability to work remotely, and data from the 2019 American Community Survey to estimate the distribution of essential frontline workers by nativity and immigrant legal status. Central to our analysis is a proxy measure of working in the primary or secondary sector of the segmented labor market. Our results indicate that a larger proportion of foreign-born workers are essential frontline workers compared to native-born workers and that 70 percent of unauthorized immigrant workers are essential frontline workers. Disparities in essential frontline worker status are most pronounced for unauthorized immigrant workers and native-born workers in the secondary sector of the labor market. These results suggest that larger proportions of foreign-born workers, and especially unauthorized immigrant workers, face greater risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace than native-born workers. Social determinants of health such as lack of access to health insurance and living in overcrowded housing indicate that unauthorized immigrant essential frontline workers may be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes related to COVID-19 than other groups of essential frontline workers. These findings help to provide a plausible explanation for why COVID-19 mortality rates for immigrants are higher than mortality rates for native-born residents.",2022,10/27/2022,9,Ryan Allen; José Pacas; Zoe Martens,Twin Cities Orthopedics; University of Minnesota; Health First; Twin Cities Orthopedics; University of Minnesota,"Migration, Health and Trauma; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Employment and Welfare Studies",International Migration Review,article,Jose D Pacas,https://openalex.org/A5004183945,American Community Survey,American Community Survey

However, the SPM still faces several critiques from scholars focused on poverty of non-metropolitan areas. Key among these critiques is the geographic adjustment for cost of living employed in the SPM, which is based solely upon median rental costs and pools together all non-metropolitan counties within each state. Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018. By comparing housing costs, tenure, and commuting, we determine median rent is likely an appropriate basis for geographic adjustment. However, by demonstrating the wide variability between median rents of non-metropolitan counties within the same state, we show that the current operationalization of this geographic adjustment is sorely lacking.",2021,5/26/2021,2,J.

WHY DO ENERGY PRICES MATTER? THE ROLE OF INTERINDUSTRY LINKAGES IN U.S. MANUFACTURING,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00168.x,"There is considerable empirical evidence that energy prices had a large effect on the U.S. economy between World War II and the 1980s. This paper argues that linkages between manufacturing industries amplify the effect of an energy price shock and help explain the large effect. In particular, energy‐intensive industries are important input suppliers to other industries. When the price of energy increases, energy‐intensive industries contract, raising materials prices for other industries. Because of the reduction in materials supply, the downstream industries also contract, which I refer to as the supply effect. Using data from the Census of Manufactures, I find that the supply effect accounted for about one half of the sensitivity of value added to the price of energy. I use plant‐level census data to show that the supply effect caused similar changes in value added per plant as in value added per industry. A price increase caused a small, although statistically significant, decrease in entry and had no effect on exit. Finally, the supply effect reduced plant‐level labor demand .

Energy Prices and the Adoption of Energy-Saving Technology,,"This paper investigates the link between factor prices, technology and factor demands. I estimate the effect of price-induced technology adoption on energy demand in the U.S. manufacturing sector, using plant data from the Census of Manufactures, 1963-1997. I compare the energy efficiency of entrants and incumbents to measure the effect of technology adoption on the demand for energy. A 10 percent increase in the price of energy causes technology adoption that reduces the energy demand of entrants by 1 percent. This elasticity has two implications: first, technology adoption explains a statistically significant but relatively small fraction of changes in energy demand in the 1970s and 1980s; and second, technology adoption can reduce the long run effect of energy prices on growth, but by less than previous research has found.",2006,4/1/2006,1,Joshua Linn,University of Illinois Chicago,"Energy, Environment, Economic Growth; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies; Climate Change Policy and Economics",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Joshua Linn,https://openalex.org/A5102996154,Census of Manufactures; Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,Census of Manufactures

Differential Privacy and the Accuracy of County-Level Net Migration Estimates,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-021-09664-5,"Abstract Each decade since the 1950s, demographers have generated high-quality net migration estimates by age, sex, and race for US counties using decennial census data as starting and ending populations. The estimates have been downloaded tens of thousands of times and widely used for planning, diverse applications, and research. Census 2020 should allow the series to extend through the 2010–2020 decade. The accuracy of new estimates, however, could be challenged by differentially private (DP) disclosure avoidance techniques in Census 2020 data products. This research brief estimates the impact of DP implementation on the accuracy of county-level net migration estimates. Using differentially private Census 2010 demonstration data, we construct a hypothetical set of DP migration estimates for 2000–2010 and compare them to published estimates, using common accuracy metrics and spatial analysis. Findings show that based on demonstration data released in 2020, net migration estimates by five-year age groups would only be accurate enough for use in about half of counties. Inaccuracies are larger in counties with populations less than 50,000, among age groups 65 and over, and among Hispanics. These problems are not fully resolved by grouping into broader age groups. Moreover, errors tend to cluster spatially in some regions of the country. Ultimately, the ability to generate accurate net migration estimates at the same level of detail as in the past will depend on the Census Bureau’s allocation of the privacy loss budget.",2021,7/8/2021,18,Richelle Winkler; Jaclyn L.W.

U.S. Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage Project,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v4i3.1310,"The U.S. Census Bureau maintains a large longitudinal research infrastructure that currently includes linked data from the 1940 census, the 2000-2010 censuses, major national surveys going back to 1973, and administrative records dating back to the 1990s. These restricted data are accessible to researchers around the U.S. via the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) network. The major shortcoming of this infrastructure is that it lacks linkable files from the decennial censuses of 1950 through 1990. Full-count microdata from these censuses are available for research, but datasets from these years do not include respondent names and therefore have not been linked over time. Respondent names for these censuses are available only via the original census returns, which are stored on 258,000 reels of microfilm.&#x0D; The Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage project (DCDL) is an initiative to recover names from the 1960-1990 censuses and to produce linked restricted microdata files for research use. We describe the results of a pilot project we completed on the 1990 census. For that pilot, we created digital images from census microfilm, hand-keyed ""truth data"" from those images, supported two teams' attempts to conduct Handwriting Recognition on the images, appended recovered names to already-existing microdata files, and linked the new 1990 census microdata records to previous and subsequent censuses. We describe our processes, the accuracy of the Handwriting Recognition, and the accuracy of the record linkage with the recovered names. We conclude by providing an update on the recently-initiated project to carry out these processes on a production scale for the 1960 through 1990 censuses.&#x0D; When combined with existing linkages between the censuses of 1940, 2000, 2010, the soon-to-be public 1950 census, and the future 2020 census, DCDL will provide the final component in a massive longitudinal data infrastructure that covers most of the U.S. population since 1940. As a multi-purpose statistical tool, the DCDL will further the U.S. Census Bureau's mission to provide high quality data on the U.S. population and support cutting-edge research in the FSRDC network. The resulting data resource will expand our understanding of population dynamics in the U.S. far beyond what is currently possible, providing transformational opportunities for research, education, and evidence-building across the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",2019,11/25/2019,2,Trent Alexander; Katie R.

Expanded Contraceptive Access Linked To Increase In College Completion Among Women In Colorado,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00066,"Public subsidies for contraception are often justified by assertions regarding their benefits for women's lives, yet there is limited contemporary evidence supporting these assertions.

The Missing Link: Data Capture Technology and the Making of a Longitudinal U.S. Census Infrastructure,https://doi.org/10.1109/mahc.2022.3195001,"Social scientists’ use of linked decennial census data has grown extensively over the past two decades. For U.S. census data before 1950, a large body of linked data has been made available within the past few years. The 2000 and 2010 decennial data have been linked to one another and back to the 1940 Census. For the censuses in between these years—from 1950 to 1990—no linked data are available yet. This paper focuses on the technological advances in data capture that have enabled this centuries-long longitudinal data infrastructure to flourish while still leaving a sizeable “missing link” from 1950 to 1990.

Reconciling Parent-Child Relationships across US Administrative Datasets,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v3i4.864,"IntroductionPopulation data capture children, parents, relatives, and others moving in and out of households. The U.S. has seen falling marriage rates, and increases in multigenerational households and complex families, young children living with grandparents, and adult children living with parents. Robust parent-child linkages are critical to understand these demographic shifts.&#x0D; Objectives and ApproachWe construct and validate parent-child linkages over a century to observe how U.S. households are changing over time. The three largest person-based datafiles in the U.S. are the decennial censuses, the Social Security Administration transaction file, and individual tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service. These sources operationalize relationships differently, capture data at various frequencies, and gather the data for unique purposes. We use probabilistic matching to observe and reconcile parent-child relationships across these sources. The data include a variety of personal identifiers including name, date of birth, parents’ names, address, and place of birth that support matching and validation.&#x0D; ResultsWe find that understanding the content, consistency, and coverage of the files before matching is critical for high quality linkages. The representativeness of the parent-child relationship file improves over time, with the weakest coverage for the Greatest Generation and the strongest coverage for Millennials. Coverage varies by source: tax data underrepresent non-white children and have duplicate records for SSNs, while names and dates of birth are missing from Census data. Multiple match rates differ among demographic groups and over time. In the matching process, the blocking variables rely on common variables across the population datasets. Our approach provides robust entity resolution for women, despite married-maiden name changes. We describe challenges due to data problems in old census records and validation changes in social security data.&#x0D; Conclusion/ImplicationsWe conduct a successful reconciliation of parent-child relationships in U.S. population level files. The project supports operational and research uses, such as the 2020 Census.

Pathways to Integration: Examining Changes in the Prevalence of Racially Integrated Neighborhoods,,"Few researchers have studied integrated neighborhoods, yet these neighborhoods offer an important window into broader patterns of segregation. We explore changes in racial integration in recent decades using decennial census tract data from 1990, 2000, and 2010. We begin by examining changes in the prevalence of racially integrated neighborhoods and find significant growth in the presence of integrated neighborhoods during this time period, with the share of metropolitan neighborhoods that are integrated increasing from just under 20 percent to just over 30 percent. We then shed light on the pathways through which these changes have occurred. We find both a small increase in the number of neighborhoods becoming integrated for the first time during this period and a more sizable increase in the share of integrated neighborhoods that remained integrated. Finally, we offer insights about which neighborhoods become integrated in the first place and which remain stably integrated over time.",2012,9/1/2012,52,Ingrid Gould Ellen; Keren Mertens Horn,,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; School Choice and Performance; Homelessness and Social Issues",Cityscape,article,Keren M Horn,https://openalex.org/A5050732266,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Decennial Census; American Housing Survey; American Community Survey,Decennial Census
Has Falling Crime Invited Gentrification?,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2930242,"Over the past two decades, crime has fallen dramatically in cities in the United States. We explore whether, in the face of falling central city crime rates, households with more resources and options were more likely to move into central cities overall and more particularly into low income and/or majority minority central city neighborhoods. We use confidential, geocoded versions of the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census and the 2010, 2011, and 2012 American Community Survey to track moves to different neighborhoods in 244 Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and their largest central cities. Our dataset includes over four million household moves across the three time periods.

Moreover, we find little evidence that households with lower incomes and without college degrees are more likely to move to cities when violent crime falls. These results hold during the 1990s as well as the 2000s and for the 100 largest metropolitan areas, where crime declines were greatest.

Homeowner Investments: Are They Shaped by Perceptions of Neighborhood Risk?,,"This paper explores how perceptions of neighborhood quality and risk shape the investment decisions of homeowners. Using the confidential, geo-coded version of the American Housing Survey, this paper links household perceptions of neighborhood quality to actual measures of neighborhood quality and estimates how these factors influence a households decision to invest in their home. This paper will be the first to include measures of neighborhood level house price appreciation, crime rates, school quality and racial composition in modeling the investment decision of a homeowner. Based on estimates from the 2003 AHS, American households spent approximately $250 billion dollars on home improvements over the course of two years, (Leventis, 2007) compared to $5.6 billion annual investment from CDBG and HOME. This large contribution from homeowners means that the future condition of our housing stock rests on the decisions made by owner-occupiers. Indirectly the future of Americas neighborhoods is also dependent on upkeep by homeowners. When a household decides whether or not to invest in improving their home, they must predict how much of their costs they will be able to recover when they sell their unit. Increased perceptions of neighborhood risk could discourage home improvement if a household believes they will not be able to recoup their financial investment when they sell the house. The household must also predict how much consumption value they will gain from the investment, which will depend on their expected length of stay. Perceptions of neighborhood risk could decrease the likelihood a household will stay in their unit, leading to lower consumption benefits from a renovation. Galster (1987) finds that households which are one unit more pessimistic on a neighborhood expectations scale are expected to spend $542 less annually on upkeep than those who are one unit less pessimistic. This represents 75% of the annual expenditure made on improvements by the average household in 1987. In this paper, I estimate the maintenance decision as a reaction function to the level of neighborhood quality and risk, the householders socioeconomic characteristics, the dwelling unit value, and the socioeconomic characteristics of the households neighbors. First I estimate which factors influence the probability a household will invest in their home, and then I look at the factors associated with the dollar value of the investment. This paper will provide a rich understanding of how perceptions of neighborhood quality and risk factor into a homeowners decision to invest in their property.",2010,11/29/2010,0,Keren Mertens Horn,University of Massachusetts Boston,"Housing Market and Economics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Keren M Horn,https://openalex.org/A5050732266,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Decennial Census; American Housing Survey; American Community Survey,American Housing Survey

"The Shifting Destinations of Metropolitan Migrants in the U.S., 2005–2011",https://doi.org/10.1111/grow.12187,"Abstract Recent estimates that central cities are growing faster than their suburbs in the U.S. have captured the attention of both academics and the popular media. Many commentators have used these numbers to claim that internal migration trends in the U.S. have reached a turning point, in which migrants increasingly prefer urban residences to suburban locales. However, these assertions often rely on problematic definitions of city and suburb, and pay too little attention to demographic variations among migrants. This paper examines whether recent internal migrants in the U.S. are choosing closer‐in destinations, drawing from microdata samples from the American Community Survey since 2005. During this period, there is an overall trend of migrants to the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. choosing to migrate closer to the metropolitan core. However, this trend varies significantly among major demographic groups; whereas younger, single, educated, and white‐collar migrants show evidence of a return to the core, migrants who are blue‐collar, less‐educated, older, and with families remain more suburban. In turn, this analysis suggests that overall trends of “back to the city” migration are producing considerable divergence in the metropolitan destinations of different demographic groups.",2017,1/12/2017,11,Kyle E.

Use of Freight Production Functions to Identify Outliers in the Commodity Flow Survey Data,,"This research aims at analyzing the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data across various years (1993, 1997, and 2007), develop methodologies to identify outliers, and to improve freight planning and modeling to help in policy development to make the freight system more efficient and sustainable. To this end, the team has developed freight production models that estimate the amount (in pounds per year) of cargo produced by the firms as a function of number of employees, industry sector, and geography. Using the most significant model the firms that behave eccentric with respect to freight compared to other firms in the same industry (at 2 digit North American Industry Classification System, NAICS) were identified. The results are presented in the form of summary tables showing the total number of firms, number of outliers per industry sector and percentage of outliers per industry sector.

Hate Crime and Human Capital,https://doi.org/10.1177/00346446241230696,"This paper examines the impact of hate crimes committed by White offenders on the educational attainment of Black individuals across United States commuting zones between 1990 and 2017. Using data on reported hate crimes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reporting Program and data on educational attainment from the decennial Census and American Community Survey, we show an increase in per-capita hate crime in a commuting zone has a statistically significant and economically meaningful negative impact on college completion for young Black individuals residing in that commuting zone. A 10% increase in per-capita hate crime committed by White offenders reduces the proportion of Black individuals aged 21 to 30 with four or more years of college between 0.12 and 0.23 percentage points, a 1% to 2% reduction relative to the sample mean. In contrast, hate crime committed by White offenders has no negative impact on educational attainment for White individuals.

Absentee Ownership and Rental Affordability: Evidence from Commuting Zones,https://doi.org/10.1080/07360932.2024.2444317,"In this paper, we examine the intersection of financialization, wealth inequality, and the housing market in the United States with an emphasis on the relationship between absentee ownership and declining rental affordability. At the same time as financialization has increasingly transformed the market for residential real estate into a vehicle for financial speculation, households at the bottom of the income distribution have been disproportionately affected by rising rents and declining housing affordability. Using data from the decennial Census and the American Community Survey from 1990 to 2020, we investigate the link between absentee ownership and rental affordability across US commuting zones. Panel fixed-effects estimates suggest a 10 percentage-point increase in absentee ownership results in a 6.7% increase in average rent, a 1.6 percentage-point increase in the ratio of median commuting zone rent to median commuting zone income, and an approximately 1.4 percentage-point increase in the share of households in a commuting zone that are rent burdened. These effects are concentrated in commuting zones with large non-white populations, and are particularly severe in commuting zones with a large share of black non-Hispanic residents. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how financialization and absentee ownership exacerbate housing affordability issues in marginalized communities and urban areas in the economic periphery, shaping the urban affordability landscape in locations beyond 'first-tier' global cities.",2024,12/27/2024,0,Luke Petach; Ireland Crowther,Belmont University; Belmont University,"Housing Market and Economics; Housing, Finance, and Neoliberalism; Banking stability, regulation, efficiency",Forum for Social Economics,article,Luke Petach,https://openalex.org/A5037657607,American Housing Survey; American Community Survey,American Community Survey
When Do Property Taxes Matter? Tax Salience and Heterogeneous Policy Effects,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4420998,"Taxes create incentives; yet, the potency of these incentives may depend on the salience and households’ perceptions of the tax itself. We investigate this issue in the context of property taxes, exploring how accurately households perceive their property tax liabilities and what factors determine misperception. Leveraging a unique national dataset, created by linking Zillow’s ZTRAX data to internal data from the American Community Survey, we first compare survey responses for how much households think they pay in property taxes to how much they actually pay based on municipal administrative records from ZTRAX. While homeowners’ tax perceptions are not substantially biased on average, we observe significant inaccuracy and systematic bias across different household(er) characteristics, institutional settings, and across states. Given that the vast majority of studies in the property tax capitalization literature use data concentrated in one state or locality, we also explore whether variation in tax misperceptions across states can help explain the heterogeneity in property tax effects on home prices. Results from a meta-analysis show that studies conducted in states with higher property tax misperceptions are significantly less likely to find property tax policy changes are fully capitalized into home prices.",2023,1/1/2023,3,Marina Gindelsky; Jeremy G.

Two groups of children are considered: those born in the US (native born) and foreign-born children who immigrated prior to age 14 (the 1.5 generation). The analyses are conducted overall, within genders, and within racial and ethnic groups.Bilingualism is more prevalent if the parents are foreign born, less proficient in English, of the same ancestry (linguistic) group, and if the child lives in an ethnic (linguistic) concentration area. Although the effects are relatively smaller, a foreign-born grandparent living in the household increases child bilingualism, while a higher level of parental education tends to decrease it. Children of Asian and especially of Hispanic origin are more likely to be bilingual than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts. Native-born Indigenous children are more likely to be bilingual.",2014,1/1/2014,1,Barry R.

Design Comparison of LODES and ACS Commuting Data Products,,"The Census Bureau produces two complementary data products, the American Community Survey (ACS) commuting and workplace data and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), which can be used to answer questions about spatial, economic, and demographic questions relating to workplaces and home-to-work flows. The products are complementary in the sense that they measure similar activities but each has important unique characteristics that provide information that the other measure cannot. As a result of questions from data users, the Census Bureau has created this document to highlight the major design differences between these two data products. This report guides users on the relative advantages of each data product for various analyses and helps explain differences that may arise when using the products.2,3 As an overview, these two data products are sourced from different inputs, cover different populations and time periods, are subject to different sets of edits and imputations, are released under different confidentiality protection mechanisms, and are tabulated at different geographic and characteristic levels. As a general rule, the two data products should not be expected to match exactly for arbitrary queries and may differ substantially for some queries. Within this document, we compare the two data products by the design elements that were deemed most likely to contribute to differences in tabulated data. These elements are: Collection, Coverage, Geographic and Longitudinal Scope, Job Definition and Reference Period, Job and Worker Characteristics, Location Definitions (Workplace and Residence), Completeness of Geographic Information and Edits/Imputations, Geographic Tabulation Levels, Control Totals, Confidentiality Protection and Suppression, and Related Public-Use Data Products. An in-depth data analysis—in aggregate or with the microdata—between the two data products will be the subject of a future technical report. The Census Bureau has begun a pilot project to integrate ACS microdata with LEHD administrative data to develop an enhanced frame of employment status, place of work, and commuting.

Two Perspectives on Commuting: A Comparison of Home to Work Flows Across Job-Linked Survey and Administrative Files,,"Commuting flows and workplace employment data have a wide constituency of users including urban and regional planners, social science and transportation researchers, and businesses. The U.S. Census Bureau releases two, national data products that give the magnitude and characteristics of home to work flows. The American Community Survey (ACS) tabulates households’ responses on employment, workplace, and commuting behavior. The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program tabulates administrative records on jobs in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). Design differences across the datasets lead to divergence in a comparable statistic: county-to-county aggregate commute flows. To understand differences in the public use data, this study compares ACS and LEHD source files, using identifying information and probabilistic matching to join person and job records. In our assessment, we compare commuting statistics for job frames linked on person, employment status, employer, and workplace and we identify person and job characteristics as well as design features of the data frames that explain aggregate differences. We find a lower rate of within-county commuting and farther commutes in LODES. We attribute these greater distances to differences in workplace reporting and to uncertainty of establishment assignments in LEHD for workers at multi-unit employers. Minor contributing factors include differences in residence location and ACS workplace edits. The results of this analysis and the data infrastructure developed will support further work to understand and enhance commuting statistics in both datasets.",2017,4/1/2017,2,Andrew S.

The models deployed for workload removal from the 2015 and 2016 Census Tests were based on associations of the 2010 Census with administrative records. Training the same models with more recent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) can identify any changes in parameter associations over time that might reduce the accuracy of model predictions. Furthermore, more recent training data would allow for the incorporation of new administrative record sources not available in 2010. However, differences in ACS methodology and the smaller sample size may limit its applicability. This paper replicates earlier results and examines model predictions based on the ACS in comparison with NRFU outcomes. The evaluation consists of a comparison of predicted counts and household compositions with actual 2015 NRFU outcomes. The main findings are an overall validation of the methodology using independent data.",2017,1/1/2017,0,Melissa C. Chow; Hubert P.

Hard to count: How survey and administrative records modeling can enhance census nonresponse followup1,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-180447,"Previous studies have shown that modeling based on administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes in U.S. Census Bureau Decennial data collection operations. We compare model predictive power when varying training data sources and evaluate the extent to which survey data can be used to reduce enumerator workload when combined with available administrative data. We perform the evaluation using the 2010 Census and the 2014 American Community Survey. Our main finding is that a large survey-based training dataset, such as the American Community Survey, can provide results comparable to Census data. Robustness checks then illustrate that even small sample survey-based training datasets can also yield comparable predictions. We also discuss a broader role for use of existing survey data in NRFU operations of statistical agencies outside of the United States when national Census or administrative data sources have only incomplete coverage of the population.",2018,8/31/2018,0,Melissa C.

Examining the Effects of Transit Lines on Commuting Using Restricted-Access Census Microdata,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4186590,"Using restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) microdata, this paper evaluates the impacts of new rail transit lines on commuting behavior in Charlotte (NC), Dallas (TX), and Los Angeles (CA). We use a novel two-dimensional propensity score matching method to construct quasi-experimental data from repeated-cross-sectional data that provide rich individual characteristics and fine-geographical-resolution block information, generating four subgroups from the sample jointly defined by before-after station opening and treatment-control. We compare changes to the four subgroups' commuting mode choice, commuting time, and commuting schedule. The results indicate that new transit lines lead to 10%, 6%, and insignificant increases in public transportation ridership for Charlotte, Dalla, and Los Angeles, respectively. At the same time, we found no significant effects on commuting time and schedule.

Characterizing the neighborhood risk environment in multisite clinic-based cohort studies: A practical geocoding and data linkages protocol for protected health information,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278672,"Maintaining patient privacy when geocoding and linking residential address information with neighborhood-level data can create challenges during research. Challenges may arise when study staff have limited training in geocoding and linking data, or when non-study staff with appropriate expertise have limited availability, are unfamiliar with a study's population or objectives, or are not affordable for the study team. Opportunities for data breaches may also arise when working with non-study staff who are not on-site. We detail a free, user-friendly protocol for constructing indices of the neighborhood risk environment during multisite, clinic-based cohort studies that rely on participants' protected health information. This protocol can be implemented by study staff who do not have prior training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and can help minimize the operational costs of integrating geographic data into public health projects. This protocol demonstrates how to: (1) securely geocode patients' residential addresses in a clinic setting and match geocoded addresses to census tracts using Geographic Information System software (Esri, Redlands, CA); (2) ascertain contextual variables of the risk environment from the American Community Survey and ArcGIS Business Analyst (Esri, Redlands, CA); (3) use geoidentifiers to link neighborhood risk data to census tracts containing geocoded addresses; and (4) assign randomly generated identifiers to census tracts and strip census tracts of their geoidentifiers to maintain patient confidentiality. Completion of this protocol generates three neighborhood risk indices (i.e., Neighborhood Disadvantage Index, Murder Rate Index, and Assault Rate Index) for patients' coded census tract locations. This protocol can be used by research personnel without prior GIS experience to easily create objective indices of the neighborhood risk environment while upholding patient confidentiality. Future studies can adapt this protocol to fit their specific patient populations and analytic objectives.",2022,12/29/2022,3,Ariann Nassel; Marta Wilson‐Barthes; Chanelle J.

Why is Productivity Correlated with Competition?,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25748,"DataTHERE are over 5000 ready-mix concrete establishments observed by the Census of Manufactures (CMF) in each year of my sample.Unfortunately, roughly one-third of these establishments are ""administrative records"" establishments; that is, they are small enough to be exempt from completing long-form census surveys.Census data for these establishments do exist, but they are generated from a combination of administrative records from other agencies and imputation, the latter of which makes them unusable for establishment-level productivity analysis.I therefore exclude all establishments that fall into this category.A second constraint is that a small handful of establishments in my sample are extensively diversified and operate in multiple SIC codes.This makes it difficult to construct a productivity residual for the ready-mix concrete portion of their business because data on their inputs are pooled at the establishment level, across all lines of production.I deal with this by excluding establishments for which less than 50% of their total sales is from ready-mix concrete.For diversified establishments that survive this exclusion, inputs devoted to ready-mix concrete are approximated by scaling the conflated input variable by the fraction of sales revenue from ready-mix concrete.Finally, I measure the establishment-level price of a cubic yard of concrete by dividing sales by quantity.I observe a small number of firms with extremal values, presumably generated by misreporting, and exclude them from the sample.It is important to note that while these establishments are excluded for regressions that depend on estimates of the productivity residuals, they are not excluded in the calculation of market-level variables; in particular, the competition indexes in Section 3.3, which are discussed below, use data for all establishments.In order to construct production function residuals as described in Section 3.4, I use data from the CMF at the establishment level for inputs, including energy, materials, equipment capital, structural capital, and labor.Energy and materials inputs are captured by expenditures reported by the CMF divided by two-digit deflators from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) productivity data base.Equipment and structural capital are the reported book value multiplied by two-digit capital rental rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Finally, labor is taken as the number of production labor hours plus quality-adjusted nonproduction worker hours.Following Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992), the quality adjustment is the relative wage, so that total labor is simply production worker hours times the ratio of total wages to production wages.Production function input elasticities for the ready-mix concrete industry are presented in Table A.I.",2019,4/1/2019,3,Matthew Backus,Columbia University,Economic theories and models; Economic Growth and Productivity; Global trade and economics,,report,Matthew R Backus,https://openalex.org/A5052002773,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey; Quarterly Financial Report Census Years; Census of Manufactures,Census of Manufactures

Welcome Mats and On‐Ramps for Older Adults: The Impact of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid Expansions on Dual Enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22259,"For many low-income Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid provides important supplemental insurance that covers out-of-pocket costs and additional benefits. We examine whether Medicaid participation by low-income adults age 65 and up increased as a result of Medicaid expansions to working-age adults under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Previous literature documents so-called ""welcome mat"" effects in other populations but has not explicitly studied older persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We extend this literature by estimating models of Medicaid participation among persons age 65 and up using American Community Survey data from 2010 to 2017 and state variation in ACA Medicaid expansions. We find that Medicaid expansions to working-age adults increased Medicaid participation among low-income older adults by 1.8 percentage points (4.4 percent). We also find evidence of an ""on-ramp"" effect; that is, low-income Medicare beneficiaries residing in expansion states who were young enough to gain coverage under the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansions before aging into Medicare were 4 percentage points (9.5 percent) more likely to have dual Medicaid coverage relative to similar individuals who either turned 65 before the 2014 expansions or resided in non-expansion states.

The Long-run Effects of Teacher Collective Bargaining,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24782,"Teacher collective bargaining is a highly debated feature of the education system in the US.This paper presents the first analysis of the effect of teacher collective bargaining laws on long-run labor market and educational attainment outcomes, exploiting the timing of passage of duty-tobargain laws across cohorts within states and across states over time.Using American Community Survey data linked to each respondent's state of birth, we examine labor market outcomes and educational attainment for 35-49 year olds, separately by gender.We find robust evidence that exposure to teacher collective bargaining laws worsens the future labor market outcomes of men: in the first 10 years after passage of a duty-to-bargain law, male earnings decline by $2,134 (or 3.93%) per year and hours worked decrease by 0.42 hours per week.The earnings estimates for men indicate that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $213.8 billion in the US annually.We also find evidence of lower male employment rates, which is driven by lower labor force participation.Exposure to collective bargaining laws leads to reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which male workers sort as well.Effects are largest among black and Hispanic men.Estimates among women are often confounded by secular trend variation, though we do find suggestive evidence of negative impacts among nonwhite women.Using data from the 1979",2018,7/1/2018,30,Michael Lovenheim; Alexander Willén,National Bureau of Economic Research; Policy Analysis (United States); Cornell University; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; University of Mississippi; Norwegian School of Economics; Cornell University; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Norwegian School of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; Policy Analysis (United States); University of Mississippi,Early Childhood Education and Development; Teacher Education and Leadership Studies; Education Discipline and Inequality,,report,Michael Lovenheim,https://openalex.org/A5070582112,Decennial Census; American Community Survey,American Community Survey
The Long-Run Effects of Teacher Collective Bargaining,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2815374,"This paper presents the first analysis of the effect of teacher collective bargaining on long-run labor market and educational attainment outcomes. Our analysis exploits the different timing across states in the passage of duty-to-bargain laws in a difference-in-difference framework to identify how exposure to teacher collective bargaining affects the long-run outcomes of students. Using American Community Survey (ACS) data linked to each respondent’s state of birth, we examine labor market outcomes and educational attainment for 35-49 year olds. Our estimates suggest that teacher collective bargaining worsens the future labor market outcomes of students: living in a state that has a duty-to-bargain law for all 12 grade-school years reduces earnings by $800 (or 2%) per year and decreases hours worked by 0.50 hours per week. The earnings estimate indicates that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $199.6 billion in the US annually. We also find evidence of lower employment rates, which is driven by lower labor force participation, as well as reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which workers sort. The effects are driven by men and nonwhites, who experience larger relative declines in long-run outcomes. Using data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we demonstrate that collective bargaining leads to sizable reductions in measured cognitive and non-cognitive skills among young adults.

Predicting the Effect of Adding a Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-019-00803-4,"Abstract The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census could affect the self-response rate, a key driver of the cost and quality of a census. We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS–census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",2019,7/17/2019,28,J.

A Comparison of Training Modules for Administrative Records Use in Nonresponse Followup Operations: The 2010 Census and the American Community Survey,,"While modeling work in preparation for the 2020 Census has shown that administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes, there is scope to examine the robustness of the models by using more recent training data. The models deployed for workload removal from the 2015 and 2016 Census Tests were based on associations of the 2010 Census with administrative records. Training the same models with more recent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) can identify any changes in parameter associations over time that might reduce the accuracy of model predictions. Furthermore, more recent training data would allow for the incorporation of new administrative record sources not available in 2010. However, differences in ACS methodology and the smaller sample size may limit its applicability. This paper replicates earlier results and examines model predictions based on the ACS in comparison with NRFU outcomes. The evaluation consists of a comparison of predicted counts and household compositions with actual 2015 NRFU outcomes. The main findings are an overall validation of the methodology using independent data.",2017,1/1/2017,0,Melissa C. Chow; Hubert P.

Hard to count: How survey and administrative records modeling can enhance census nonresponse followup1,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-180447,"Previous studies have shown that modeling based on administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes in U.S. Census Bureau Decennial data collection operations. We compare model predictive power when varying training data sources and evaluate the extent to which survey data can be used to reduce enumerator workload when combined with available administrative data. We perform the evaluation using the 2010 Census and the 2014 American Community Survey. Our main finding is that a large survey-based training dataset, such as the American Community Survey, can provide results comparable to Census data. Robustness checks then illustrate that even small sample survey-based training datasets can also yield comparable predictions. We also discuss a broader role for use of existing survey data in NRFU operations of statistical agencies outside of the United States when national Census or administrative data sources have only incomplete coverage of the population.",2018,8/31/2018,0,Melissa C.

Estimating the Potential Effects of Adding a Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census,,"The self-response rate is a key driver of the cost and quality of a census. The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census could affect the self-response rate. We predict the effect of the addition of a citizenship question on self-response by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 Census, which did not have a citizenship question, and the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS), which included a citizenship question for the same housing units. To distinguish a citizenship question effect from other factors, we compare the actual ACS-Census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens to the ACS-Census difference for all-U.S. citizen households.We estimate the addition of a citizenship question will have a 5.8 percentage point (ppt) larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to all-U.S. citizen households.

Predicting the Effect of Adding a Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census,,"The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census could affect the self-response rate, a key driver of the cost and quality of a census. We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS-census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",2019,1/1/2019,0,J.

"Cultural Reproduction or Cultural Repertoire: Women Leaders, Legitimacy and Firm Performance in Family and Nonfamily Firms",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4766853,"Despite the equivocal findings that look to explain the ongoing implications for women leaders of family and nonfamily firms, little research has explored the underlying mechanisms that may enable or inhibit women leaders to be effective in their roles. Practice theory, rooted in sociology, looks at the dynamic interplay between structure and behaviors, while addressing the role of individual agency to help understand the formation, reproduction and changes in culture. We argue that nonfamily firms, having limited exposure and knowledge to a multiplicity of roles that women can take on, will categorize women leaders myopically in a traditional gender-stereotypical framework, thrusting on doubt and conflict and undermining her ability to lead. According to Bourdieu's argument of cultural reproduction, this symbolic violence will result in nonfamily firm women leaders' failure to be seen as legitimate, diminishing their ability to positively impact their firms. On the other hand, family firms, which have historically engaged women in a variety of family and business roles, have an expansive cultural repertoire of knowledge, skills and symbols to constructure new ""strategies of action."" Based on Swidler's cultural toolkit model, this vast cultural knowledge enables family firms to legitimize women's leadership roles, providing her with robust latitude and support in decision making and firm impact. Applying these cultural theories to data from the U.S. Census's Survey of Business Owners, and consistent with prior empirical findings, we show that women leaders of family firms reap higher levels of firm performance compared to their nonfamily firm counterparts.",2024,1/1/2024,1,Eric Kushins; Myriam Quispe‐Agnoli,Berry College,"Family Business Performance and Succession; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",,preprint,Myriam Quispe-Agnoli,https://openalex.org/A5074172606,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; Survey of Business Owners,Survey of Business Owners
COVID-19–Related Stressors and Mental Health Disorders Among US Adults,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221120451,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe mental health repercussions. We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. Methods: We merged data from the April 2020–March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Results: Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not. Conclusions: Levels of anxiety and depression rose during the pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable individuals and those experiencing economic and service disruptions. Future research should assess the effectiveness of policies targeting COVID-19 economic and service disruptions.",2022,9/8/2022,21,Rebekah Levine Coley; Naoka Carey; Christopher F.

An Assessment of the National Representativeness of Children in the 2007 Panel Study of Income Dynamics,,"There are many ways that nationally-representative samples drawn for panel surveys can become non-representative over time. For example, selective attrition and non-response, immigration, and shortcomings in the initial sample may lead to a divergence of the panel sample from the corresponding population it seeks to represent. Although initial cross-sectional weights together with attrition weights in later waves may correct for some sources of nonrepresentativeness, they do not correct for all possible sources. Furthermore, a periodic reassessment of sample representativeness is important for understanding the cumulative effects of attrition and immigration and determining whether additional measures are necessary to correct for declining representativeness and coverage. In this technical report, we assess the national representativeness of the 2007 sample of children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)—a total of approximately 7,100 children aged 0–17 years of age. We evaluated the national coverage of the PSID child sample using microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) and a new statistical technique called generalized boosted regression models. The ACS provides a gold-standard comparison based on its extremely high (98%) response rate, excellent data quality and completeness, and large sample sizes (approximately 700,000 children aged 0–17 years in 2007). We constructed a reasonably consistent set of covariates across PSID and ACS to describe children on the basis of their age, race/ethnicity, sex, poverty status, geographic region, and having a foreign-born parent. The generalized boosted models provided flexible, non-parametric estimates for assessing the relationship between our dependent variable (an indicator of whether an observation in the pooled ACS-PSID sample came from PSID) on covariates and their interactions. We also used the ACS sample to identify cases that are logically excluded from PSID (specifically, children whose parents are both post-1997 immigrants to the U.S.), and assess the size and composition of this group. Our results reveal that PSID child sample provides good representation of the corresponding national population with coverage of approximately 97% of the U.S. population of children in 2007 and reasonable balance for most groups, although with some exceptions.",2012,1/1/2012,13,Denise Duffy; Narayan Sastry,,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Health disparities and outcomes; Survey Methodology and Nonresponse",,article,Narayan Sastry,https://openalex.org/A5008981357,American Community Survey (ACS) and Linked HUD-Subsidized Administrative data; American Community Survey,American Community Survey

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,1/1/2022,51,Daron Acemoğlu; Gary Clayton Anderson; David N.

Navigating Statistical Uncertainty: How Urban and Regional Planners Understand and Work With American Community Survey (ACS) Data for Guiding Policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1440182,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: The American Community Survey (ACS) is a crucial source of socio­demographic data for planners. Since ACS data are estimates rather than actual counts, they contain a degree of statistical uncertainty—referred to as margin of error (MOE)—that planners must navigate when using these data. The statistical uncertainty is magnified when one is working with data for small areas or subgroups of the population or cross-tabulating demographic characteristics. We interviewed (n = 7) and surveyed (n = 200) planners and find that many do not understand the statistical uncertainty in ACS data, find it difficult to communicate statistical uncertainty to stakeholders, and avoid reporting MOEs altogether. These practices may conflict with planners' ethical obligations under the AICP Code of Ethics to disclose information in a clear and direct way.Takeaway for practice: We argue that the planning academy should change its curriculum requirements and that the profession should improve professional development training to ensure planners understand data uncertainty and convey it to users. We suggest planners follow 5 guidelines when using ACS data: Report MOEs, indicate when they are not reporting MOEs, provide context for the level of statistical reliability, consider alternatives for reducing statistical uncertainty, and always conduct statistical tests when comparing ACS estimates.",2018,4/3/2018,22,Jason R.

Who are the People in my Neighborhood?: The “Contextual Fallacy” of Measuring Individual Context with Census Geographies,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12192,"Scholars frequently use counts of populations aggregated into geographic units like census tracts to represent measures of neighborhood context. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units can dramatically alter analyses conducted with these units. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude or its capacity to affect analytical results obtained using these contextual measures. Using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we can construct—for all persons in the U.S.—individual‐specific contexts, which we group according to Census‐assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual‐specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the degree to which published measures could be affected by how boundaries are drawn using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy—a measure of ethno‐racial diversity), we find that block‐level Census statistics frequently contain a high degree of uncertainty meaning that they may not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the uncertainty associated with contextual variables at all three scales.",2019,2/21/2019,32,Christopher S. Fowler; Nathan Frey; David C.

Who are the people in my neighborhood?: The 'contextual fallacy' of measuring individual context with census geographies,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,"Scholars deploy census-based measures of neighborhood context throughout the social sciences and epidemiology. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC).

More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales.

UrbanPop: A spatial microsimulation framework for exploring demographic influences on human dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102844,"Ensuring the social equity of planning measures in social systems requires an understanding of human dynamics, particularly how individual relationships, activities, and interactions intersect with individual needs. Spatial microsimulation models (SMSMs) support planning for human security goals by representing human dynamics through realistic, georeferenced synthetic populations, that a) provide a complete representation of social systems while b) also protecting individual privacy. In this paper, we present UrbanPop, an open and reproducible SMSM framework for analysis of human dynamics with high spatial, temporal, and demographic resolution. UrbanPop creates synthetic populations of demographically detailed worker and student agents, positioning them first at probable nighttime locations (home), then moving them to probable daytime locations (work/school). Summary aggregations of these populations match the granular detail available at the census block group level in the American Community Survey Summary File (SF), providing realistic approximations of the actual population. UrbanPop users can select particular demographic traits important in their application, resulting in a highly tailored agent population. We first lay out UrbanPop's baseline methodology, including population synthesis, activity modeling, and diagnostics, then demonstrate these capabilities by developing case studies of shifting population distributions and high-risk populations in Knox County, TN during the global COVID-19 pandemic.",2022,12/15/2022,7,Joseph Tuccillo; Robert Stewart; Amy Rose; Nathan Trombley; Jessica Moehl; Nicholas N.

File Matching with Faulty Continuous Matching Variables,,"We present LFCMV, a Bayesian file linking methodology designed to link records using continuous matching variables in situations where we do not expect values of these matching variables to agree exactly across matched pairs. The method involves a linking model for the distance between the matching variables of records in one file and the matching variables of their linked records in the second. This linking model is conditional on a vector indicating the links. We specify a mixture model for the distance component of the linking model, as this latent structure allows the distance between matching variables in linked pairs to vary across types of linked pairs. Finally, we specify a model for the linking vector. We describe the Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of this linkage model and use artificial data to illustrate model performance. We also introduce a linking application using public survey information and data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures and use LFCMV to link the records.",2017,1/1/2017,0,Nicole M. Dalzell; Jerome P.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,1/1/2022,51,Daron Acemoğlu; Gary Clayton Anderson; David N.

"AI Adoption in America: Who, What, and Where",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4609858,"We study the early adoption and diffusion of five AI-related technologies (automated-guided vehicles, machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and voice recognition) as documented in the 2018 Annual Business Survey of 850,000 firms across the United States.

Identifying Individual and Group Effects in the Presence of Sorting: A Neighborhood Effects Application,,"Researchers have long recognized that the non-random sorting of individuals into groups generates correlation between individual and group attributes that is likely to bias naive estimates of both individual and group effects. This paper proposes a non-parametric strategy for identifying these effects in a model that allows for both individual and group unobservables, applying this strategy to the estimation of neighborhood effects on labor market outcomes. The first part of this strategy is guided by a robust feature of the equilibrium in vertical sorting models - a monotonic relationship between neighborhood housing prices and neighborhood quality. This implies that under certain conditions a non-parametric function of neighborhood housing prices serves as a suitable control function for the neighborhood unobservable in the labor market outcome regression. This control function transforms the problem to a model with one unobservable so that traditional instrumental variables solutions may be applied. In our application, we instrument for each individual's observed neighborhood attributes with the average neighborhood attributes of a set of observationally identical individuals. The neighborhood effects model is estimated using confidential microdata from the 1990 Decennial Census for the Boston MSA.

Workersʼ Decisions to Take-Up Offered Health Insurance Coverage: Assessing the Importance of Out-of-Pocket Premium Costs,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200307007-00005,"Background. Many proposed policy initiatives involve subsidies directed toward encouraging employers to offer coverage and toward workers to encourage enrollment in offered plans. Given that insurance coverage reflects employers' decisions to offer coverage, eligibility requirements for such coverage, and employees' take-up decisions, all three elements are important when considering mechanisms to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. Research Design. In this study, we examine the relationship between workers' decisions to take-up offers of health insurance and annual out-of-pocket contributions, total premiums, and employer and workforce characteristics.

We find that workers are less likely to enroll in coverage as single employee contributions increase. Our results for family contributions are much smaller than for single contributions and are not statistically significant in all years. Our simulation results suggest that reducing employee contribution levels for single coverage from existing levels in 1999 to zero would yield an increase in take-up rates of roughly 6% points in establishments that had required a positive level of contributions. Our results also indicate that of the 13.8 million private sector workers who decline coverage from their employers, 2.5 million would potentially enroll in employer-sponsored coverage if the cost of single coverage were to fall to zero.

“New White Ethnics” or “New Latinos”? Hispanic/Latino Pan-ethnicity and Ancestry Reporting among South American Immigrants to the United States,https://doi.org/10.1177/0197918321993100,"This article explores the identification patterns of South American immigrants to the United States, as measured via Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting on the US Census. Using data from the 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 American Community Survey, my analysis reveals four main findings. First, I show significant heterogeneity in identity patterns and in sociodemographic, immigration, and geographic characteristics between South American and Mexican immigrants in the United States. Second, I find that Southern Cone immigrants opt not to report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and “birth-country” ancestry (ancestry that is concordant with birth country, such as Colombian or Chilean) to a greater extent than Andean immigrants and, instead, report more distal “ancestral-origin” ancestries (i.e., Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Third, I show that those immigrants who do report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are more likely to report “birth-country” ancestry than “ancestral-origin” ancestry, net of other factors. Finally, my analysis demonstrates that Brazilian immigrants chart a different path of identification among South American immigrants and almost unanimously do not report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity while overwhelmingly reporting “Brazilian” ancestry. Taken together, variation in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting across South American immigrant groups has implications for their incorporation into US society, as well as for the degree to which these immigrants see themselves as racialized actors in the United States. Some South American immigrant groups (Southern Cone immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New White ethnics,” and others (Andean immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New Latinos.” Researchers of international migration should carefully consider these identification differences and their implications for the measurement and study of “Hispanic/Latino” immigrants and their descendants in the United States.",2021,3/9/2021,11,Rebecca Anna Schut,University of Pennsylvania,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma",International Migration Review,article,Rebecca A Schut,https://openalex.org/A5078350044,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence); American Community Survey,American Community Survey
The Painful and Chilling Effects of Legal Violence: Immigration Enforcement and Racialized Legal Status Inequities in Worker Well-Being,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-024-09862-x,"A wave of restrictive immigration policies implemented over the past several decades dramatically increased immigrant detentions and deportations in the United States (U.S.), with important consequences for a host of immigrant outcomes. Still, questions remain as to how temporal and geographic variation in immigration enforcement within and across the U.S. shaped racialized legal status inequities in health and well-being, particularly among those employed in precarious occupations. To fill this gap, we interrogated the links between changes in county-level immigration enforcement and racialized legal status inequalities in musculoskeletal pain and social welfare benefits utilization among U.S. agricultural workers over nearly two decades (2002–2018). We merged data from three sources [(1) restricted-access, geocoded data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) (n = 37,619); (2) county-level immigration enforcement data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC); and (3) population data from the Census and American Community Survey (ACS)] and estimated linear probability models with year, month, and state fixed effects. We show that, in counties with high enforcement rates, workers—especially undocumented workers—were at increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, including pain that was severe. Heightened enforcement was also associated with declines in needs-based benefits utilization, especially among documented and U.S.-citizen non-White workers and undocumented White and non-White workers. Together, these findings highlight how changes in sociopolitical and legal contexts can shift and maintain racialized legal status hierarchies, with especially important consequences for the well-being of vulnerable workers.",2024,3/13/2024,0,Courtney Boen; Rebecca Anna Schut; Nicholas Graetz,University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago; Princeton University,"Employment and Welfare Studies; Migration, Health and Trauma; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research",Population Research and Policy Review,article,Rebecca A Schut,https://openalex.org/A5078350044,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence); American Community Survey,American Community Survey
Busy Businesses and Busy Contexts: The Distribution and Sources of Crime at Commercial Properties,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427819848083,"Objective: Examine the distribution and sources of crime across freestanding businesses in San Antonio. We test hypotheses about the main and interactive effects of neighborhood and business characteristics on crime at the business, with a focus on busy contexts and busy businesses. Method: Police crime incident data are spatially joined to study area business parcels. Additional data sources include Infogroup USA Business Data, the American Community Survey, and an Environmental Protection Agency traffic activity indicator. Multilevel negative binomial regression models are estimated to observe the main and interactive effects of census block group and business variables on crime at the parcel. Results: Businesses located in block groups with more commercial property and high levels of vehicular traffic experience more crime. In addition, crime is higher at “busy” businesses, as indicated by employee size, sales volume, and square footage. Busy contexts and busy businesses do not appear to interact to increase crime at the parcel beyond their main effects. Conclusions: Crime is clustered at relatively few businesses, and this variation cannot be explained by business type alone.

Toward a Cross-Platform Framework: Assessing the Comprehensiveness of Online Rental Listings.,,"Research on rental housing markets in the United States has traditionally relied on national or local housing surveys. Those sources lack temporal and spatial specificity, limiting their use for tracking short-term changes in local markets. As rental housing ads have transitioned to digital spaces, a growing body of literature has utilized web scraping to analyze listing practices and variations in rental market dynamics. Those studies have primarily relied on one platform, Craigslist, as a source of data. Despite Craigslist's popularity, the authors contend that rental listings from various websites, rather than from individual ones, provide a more comprehensive picture. Using a mixed-methods approach to study listings across various platforms in five metropolitan areas, this article demonstrates considerable variation in both the types of rental units advertised and the features provided across those platforms. The article begins with an account of the birth and consolidation of online rental platforms and emergent characteristics of several selected websites, including the criteria for posting, search parameters, search results priority, and first-page search results. Visualizations are used to compare features such as the 40th percentile of rent, rent distribution, and bedroom size based on scraped data from six online platforms (Padmapper, Forrent.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and GoSection8), 2020 Fair Market Rents, and 2019 American Community Survey data. The analyses indicate that online listing platforms target different audiences and offer distinct information on units within those market segments, resulting in markedly different estimates of local rental costs and unit size distribution depending on the platform.",2021,1/1/2021,4,Ana Vitória Monteiro Costa; Victoria Sass; Ian Kennedy; Roshni Roy; Rebecca J.

COVID-19–Related Stressors and Mental Health Disorders Among US Adults,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221120451,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe mental health repercussions. We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. Methods: We merged data from the April 2020–March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Results: Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not. Conclusions: Levels of anxiety and depression rose during the pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable individuals and those experiencing economic and service disruptions.

"Trends in mental health symptoms, service use, and unmet need for services among US adults through the first 8 months of the COVID-19 pandemic",https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab133,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rising morbidity, mortality, and social and economic disruption, likely impairing mental health. The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among US adults, and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 US Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,302,455 US adults, weighted to represent the US population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication and counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 37% and 29%, respectively, by November, 2020, rates more than four times higher than early 2019 US norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single parent, female, Black and multi-racial respondents, with some vacillation in such disparities over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19.The myriad stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impaired mental health and wellbeing. Although evidence from early in the pandemic revealed elevated rates of mental health conditions, research has not documented whether psychological disorders have continued to rise as the pandemic has persisted. In this research, we assess data from over 1.3 million US adults who participated in cross-sectional surveys between April and November, 2020 to track trends in mental health disorder symptoms and services. Our results show that reports of anxiety and depression rose significantly from April to November, 2020 to rates more than four-times higher than in 2019. We also found evidence of growing unmet need for mental health services. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women.

The proportion of renters perceiving some risk and high risk for eviction both generally fell over time. These patterns were evident for all demographic subgroups, but there were clear and persistent disparities. Black and Hispanic households reported higher rates of both rental arrears and perceived risk for eviction throughout the time period compared with White households.

Regional trade and “the medicine line”: The national border effect in U.S. commodity flow data,https://doi.org/10.1080/08865655.1998.9695516,"Abstract The role of national borders in the international economy has been a topic of widespread public discussion in recent years. The conventional wisdom on the topic is that in an increasingly integrated global economy with relatively low formal trade barriers, national borders are no longer important inhibitors of trade. McCallum (1995) cast some doubt on this belief when he found that, after adjusting for economic size and geographic distance, trade among Canadian provinces was more than twenty times greater than trade between those same provinces and U.S. states. The 1993 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to verify these surprising results, as well as to investigate subsequent questions, such as why the border matters, and how it affects economic welfare. This paper reviews the existing literature on the geography of trade flows, describes the CFS, and attempts to verify the McCallum result at the aggregate level. Despite a number of a priori reasons to believe otherwise, the author finds that CFS estimates of the “border effect” are almost exactly equivalent to those estimated by McCallum.",1998,9/1/1998,33,Russell Hillberry,Indiana University,Global trade and economics; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis,Journal of Borderlands Studies,article,Russell Hillberry,https://openalex.org/A5063069804,Census of Mining; Census of Manufactures; Commodity Flow Survey,Commodity Flow Survey
The Volume Of TV Advertisements During The ACA’s First Enrollment Period Was Associated With Increased Insurance Coverage,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1440,"The launch of the Affordable Care Act was accompanied by major insurance information campaigns by government, nonprofit, political, news media, and private-sector organizations, but it is not clear to what extent these efforts were associated with insurance gains. Using county-level data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and broadcast television airings data from the Wesleyan Media Project, we examined the relationship between insurance advertisements and county-level health insurance changes between 2013 and 2014, adjusting for other media and county- and state-level characteristics. We found that counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties. State-sponsored advertisements had the strongest relationship with declines in uninsurance, and this relationship was driven by increases in Medicaid enrollment. These results support the importance of strategic investment in advertising to increase uptake of health insurance but suggest that not all types of advertisements will have the same effect on the public.",2017,3/16/2017,30,Pinar Karaca‐Mandic; Andrew D.

Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012,,"We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms.

The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23381,"Despite dramatic workforce gains by women in recent decades, a substantial gender earnings gap persists and widens over the course of men's and women's careers.Since there are earnings differences across establishments, a key question is the extent to which the widening of the gender pay gap over time arises from differences in career advances within the same establishment versus differential gains from job-to-job moves across establishments.Using a unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, we find that both channels are important and affect workers differently by education.For the college-educated the increasing gap is for the most part due to differential earnings growth within establishment.The between-establishment component explains only 27 percent of the widening of the total gender pay gap for this group.For workers without college degree, the establishment component is the main driver of the, relatively small, widening of the gender earnings gap.For both education groups, marriage plays a crucial role in the establishment component of the increasing earnings gap.",2017,5/1/2017,27,Erling Barth; Sari Pekkala Kerr; Claudia Olivetti,Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; Forskning.no (Norway); National Bureau of Economic Research; Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College,"Corporate Finance and Governance; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics",,report,Sari Kerr,https://openalex.org/A5003192480,Decennial Census; Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue; BOC Census Numident (CNUM),Decennial Census
The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3029846,"We use a unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to analyze how much of the increase in the gender earnings gap over the lifecycle comes from shifts in the sorting of men and women across high- and low-pay establishments and how much is due to differential earnings growth within establishments. We find that for the college educated the increase is substantial and, for the most part, due to differential earnings growth within establishment by gender. The between component is also important. Differential mobility between establishments by gender can explain 27 percent of the widening of the pay gap for this group. For those with no college the relatively small increase of the gender gap over the lifecycle can be fully explained by differential moves by gender across establishments.

"Inferentially Valid, Partially Synthetic Data: Generating from Posterior Predictive Distributions not Necessary",,"To limit the risks of disclosures when releasing public use data on individual records, statistical agencies and other data disseminators can release multiply-imputed, partially synthetic data (Little, 1993; Reiter, 2003). These comprise the units originally surveyed with some collected values, e.g. sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of quasi-identifiers, replaced with multiple imputations. Partially synthetic data can protect confidentiality, since identification of units and their sensitive data can be difficult when select values in the released data are not actual, collected values. And, with appropriate estimation methods based on the concepts of multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), they enable data users to make valid inferences for a variety of estimands using standard, complete-data statistical methods and software. Because of these appealing features, partially synthetic data products have been developed for several major data sources in the U.S., including the Longitudinal Business Database (Kinney et al., 2011), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (Abowd et al., 2006), the American Community Survey group quarters data (Hawala, 2008), and the OnTheMap database of where people live and work (Machanavajjhala et al., 2008). Other examples of partially synthetic data are described in Abowd and Woodcock (2004), Little et al. (2004), Drechsler et al. (2008), and Drechsler and Reiter (2010). In the statistical theory underlying the generation of partially synthetic data, as well as typical implementations in practice, replacement values are sampled from posterior predictive distributions. That is, the agency repeatedly draws values of the model parameters from their posterior distributions, and generates a set of replacement values based on each parameter draw. The motivation for sampling from posterior predictive distributions derives from multiple imputation of missing data, in which drawing the parameters is necessary to enable approximately unbiased variance estimation (Rubin, 1987, Chapter 4). In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to draw parameters to enable valid inferences with partially synthetic data. Instead, data disseminators can estimate posterior modes or maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in synthesis models, and simulate replacement values after plugging those modes into the models. Using a simple but informative case, we show mathematically that point and variance estimates based on the plug-in",2012,5/31/2012,31,Jerome P. Reiter; Satkartar K.

Bargaining Power in Firm-to-Firm Relationships - Two Methodologies to Detect Outliers in the Census Trade Data,,"This note develops two methodologies to detect possibly incorrectly reported shipment values and quantities in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). Both approaches seek to identify outliers in terms of unit values, defined as the ratio of value and quantity shipped. The first methodology examines trades in the far tails of the cross-sectional unit value distribution across importers or exporters, and highlights those trades that appear incompatible with a given U.S. firm's own transactions. The second approach identifies outliers as cases where a unit value jumps by an order of magnitude compared to a U.S. firm's transactions over the past two years. While both approaches reveal that outliers are relatively rare, the note highlights several cases where outliers were very large and possibly affected trade statistics. The note further presents distributions of outliers by value and discusses the countries and products that exhibit the largest shares of outliers. It also presents a number of examples to showcase that outliers identified by the two methodologies appear suspicious also to a human looking at the data. The note concludes with a discussion of the advantages and the disadvantages of the two approaches.

Wage Premia in Employment Clusters: Agglomeration Economies or Worker Heterogeneity?,,"The correlation between wage premia and concentrations of firm activity may arise due to agglomeration economies or workers sorting by unobserved productivity. A worker's residential location is used as a proxy for their unobservable productivity attributes in order to test whether estimated work location wage premia are robust to the inclusion of these controls. Further, in a locational equilibrium, identical workers must receive equivalent compensation so that after controlling for residential location (housing prices) and commutes workers must be paid the same wages and only wage premia arising from unobserved productivity differences should remain unexplained. The models in this paper are estimated using a sample of male workers residing in 33 large metropolitan areas drawn from the 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census. We find that wages are higher when an individual works in a location that has more workers or a greater density of workers. These agglomeration effects are robust to the inclusion of residential location controls and disappear with the inclusion of commute time suggesting that the effects are not caused by unobserved differences in worker productivity.

The models suggests that African-American households may outbid white households to reside in white neighborhoods, and unlike previous models of segregation this model is consistent with either racial segregation or integration. In the empirical analysis, proxy variables are developed for unobservable attributes that enter household preferences based on measures of household outcomes and satisfaction, and then specifies an econometric model of residential location choice using those attributes.

Racial Differences in Homeownership: The Effect of Residential Location,,"The rate of homeownership among African-American households is considerably lower than white households in American urban areas. This paper examines whether racial differences in residential location outcomes are among the factors that contribute to the large racial differences in homeownership rates in major US metropolitan areas. Based on the 1985 metropolitan sample of the American Housing Survey for Philadelphia, the paper does not find any evidence that existing racial differences in residential location in Philadelphia decrease the homeownership rate among African Americans. Rather, the empirical evidence suggests that African-American residential location outcomes are associated with lower than expected racial differences in homeownership. Therefore, after controlling for neighborhood, racial differences in homeownership are larger than originally believed, and the ability of racial differences in endowments to explain homeownership differences is more limited.",2002,11/22/2002,3,Yongheng Deng; Stephen L.

Racial Differences in Homeownership: The Effect of Residential Location,,"The rate of homeownership among African-American households is considerably lower than white households in American urban areas. This paper examines whether racial differneces in residential location outcomes are among the factors that contribute to the large racial differences in homeownership rates in major US metropolitan areas. Based on the 1985 metropolitan sample of the American Housing Survey for Philadelphia, the paper does not find any evidence that existing racial differences in residential location in Philadelphia decrease the homeownership rate among African Americans. Rather, the empirical evidence suggests that African-American residential location outcomes are associated with lower than expected racial differences in homeownership. Therefore, after controlling for neighborhood, racial differences in homeownership are larger than originally believed, and the ability of racial differences in endowments to explain hoeownership differences is more limited.",2002,7/1/2002,2,Yongheng Deng; Stephen L.

Are Shirking and Leisure Substitutable? An Empirical Test of Efficiency Wages Based on Urban Economic Theory,,"Recent theoretical work has examined the spatial distribution of unemployment using the efficiency wage model as the mechanism by which unemployment arises in the urban economy. This paper extends the standard efficiency wage model in order to allow for behavioral substitution between leisure time at home and effort at work. In equilibrium, residing at a location with a long commute affects the time available for leisure at home and therefore affects the trade-off between effort at work and risk of unemployment. This model implies an empirical relationship between expected commutes and labor market outcomes, which is tested using the Public Use Microdata sample of the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census. The empirical results suggest that efficiency wages operate primarily for blue collar workers, i.e. workers who tend to be in occupations that face higher levels of supervision. For this subset of workers, longer commutes imply higher levels of unemployment and higher wages, which are both consistent with shirking and leisure being substitutable.",2007,2/1/2007,1,Stephen L.

Segregation and Racial Preferences: An Analysis of Choice Based on Satisfaction and Outcome Measures,,"This paper investigates the notion that preferences for neighborhood racial composition may be modeled as derived demands than arise from the preferences that households have for social interaction where factors such as prejudice or cultural affinity affect the quality of across group social interactions. The paper sets up a simple consumer utility maximization problems and uses the dual of this problem to investigate the bidding and sorting of households over racial composition. The models suggests that we cannot rule out the possibility that African-American households outbid white households to reside in white neighborhoods even with a very strong set of assumptions. The paper then specifies an econometric model of residential location choice in which the unobservable attributes that actually enter household preferences are replaced with instruments based on measures of household outcomes and satisfaction. The model is estimated using the 1985 metropolitan sample of the American Housing Survey for Philadelphia.

Preliminary Analysis of the Distributions of Carbon and Energy Intensity for 27 Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industrial Sectors,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1925133,"It is well documented that different manufacturing sectors require different amounts of energy. Primary materials conversion, e.g., iron ore and scrap into steel, limestone and sand into cement and glass, or wood and other fibers into paper, tend to be the most energy-intensive in the production process, while final consumer products like electronics and clothing require the least energy. This leads to something like the 80-20 rule, where a large portion of energy use is in a small number of industries. For example, the 2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) reported that 75 percent of fuel use arises from only five of the 21 three-digit industries, using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These five sectors are a small share of the total U.S. economy. The energy intensity for different industrial sectors is easily measured using published government statistics, but the plants within these industries are not homogeneous entities. This report measures the differences in energy use and associated CO2 emissions as a first step to understanding the within-sector heterogeneity of energy use.",2011,1/1/2011,1,Gale Boyd; Tatyana Kuzmenko; Béla Személy; Gang Zhang,Duke University; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Boston University; Quest University Canada,"Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies; Vehicle emissions and performance",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Tatyana V Kuzmenko,https://openalex.org/A5040736206,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey; Census of Finance Insurance and Real Estate; Decennial Census,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey

Testing biasedness of self-reported microbusiness innovation in the annual business survey,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296667,"This study tests for potential bias in self-reported innovation due to the inclusion of a research and development (R&amp;D) module that only microbusinesses (less than 10 employees) receive in the Annual Business Survey (ABS). Previous research found that respondents to combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys reported innovation at lower rates than respondents to innovation-only surveys. A regression discontinuity design is used to test whether microbusinesses, which constitute a significant portion of U.S. firms with employees, are less likely to report innovation compared to other small businesses. In the vicinity of the 10-employee threshold, the study does not detect statistically significant biases for new-to-market and new-to-business product innovation. Statistical power analysis confirms the nonexistence of biases with a high power. Comparing the survey design of ABS to earlier combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys provides valuable insights for the proposed integration of multiple Federal surveys into a single enterprise platform survey. The findings also have important implications for the accuracy and reliability of innovation data used as an input to policymaking and business development strategies in the United States.",2024,1/12/2024,0,Luyi Han; Zheng Tian; Timothy R.

After a brief introduction to past NCSES efforts measuring innovation, we examine overall innovation patterns of all businesses and then the extent and type of innovative firms with 1 to 9 employees, both based on the 2017 Annual Business Survey (ABS). We provide a quantitative test of the hypotheses that (i) there is a division of ""innovative labor"" - i.e., labor specialized in inventive activity commonly associated with R&D - that concentrates much radical innovation in small firms and (ii) innovation in the services often happens at a much smaller scale than in manufacturing.

A novel framework for increasing research transparency: Exploring the connection between diversity and innovation,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313826,"A split sample/dual method research protocol is demonstrated to increase transparency while reducing the probability of false discovery. We apply the protocol to examine whether diversity in ownership teams increases or decreases the likelihood of a firm reporting a novel innovation using data from the 2018 United States Census Bureau’s Annual Business Survey. Transparency is increased in three ways: 1) all specification testing and identifying potentially productive models is done in an exploratory subsample that 2) preserves the validity of hypothesis test statistics from de novo estimation in the holdout confirmatory sample with 3) all findings publicly documented in an earlier registered report and in this journal publication. Bayesian estimation procedures that leverage information from the exploratory stage included in the confirmatory stage estimation replace traditional frequentist null hypothesis significance testing. In addition to increasing statistical power by using information from the full sample, Bayesian methods directly estimate a probability distribution for the magnitude of an effect, allowing much richer inference. Estimated magnitudes of diversity along academic discipline, race, ethnicity, and foreign-born status dimensions are positively associated with innovation. A maximally diverse ownership team on these dimensions would be roughly six times more likely to report new-to-market innovation than a homophilic team.",2025,1/9/2025,0,Timothy R. Wojan; Dayton M.

Potential of Newness: Spatial and Organizational Dynamics of Entrepreneurship,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2017.13086abstract,"This paper analyzes how entrepreneurs fare in intermediary market segments when the intermediary market segment is closely attached to a single supplier market. While focusing on two structural constraints, organizational and spatial factors, I build off of the fact that in the past thirty years in the U.S. beer industry, as the number of beer producers (i.e. brewers) proliferated, their intermediaries (i.e. wholesalers) declined. Using establishment-level restricted-access economic microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database and the Census of Wholesale Trade, I examine what happens with the intermediaries when (some) producers start competing on product variety instead of competing on scale. I find that Stinchcombe’s ‘liability of newness’ principle can get suspended and certain newcomers have better survival chances than industry incumbents. That is, entrepreneurial establishments fare better if they are part of well-resourced multiunit firms and are entering the market in an area where a large proportion of establishments exited previously. The results highlight how organizational factors and geography create inequalities among intermediary organizations.",2017,8/1/2017,0,Tünde Cserpes,University of Illinois Chicago,Wine Industry and Tourism; Forest Management and Policy; Organic Food and Agriculture,Academy of Management Proceedings,article,Tunde Cserpes,https://openalex.org/A5028061219,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200; Census of Wholesale Trade; Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,Census of Wholesale Trade

"High-Skilled Immigration, Domestic Innovation, and Global Exchanges",,"High-skilled immigrants account for about 25 percent of the workers in the most innovative and entrepreneurial U.S. industries, and they are responsible for a roughly similar share of out-put measures like patents or firm starts. Immigrants have also accounted for the majority of the growth in the U.S. scientific workforce since the 1990s. The magnitudes of these contributions make understanding the economic consequences of immigration an important research priority. In this piece, I summarize the major themes that have emerged from my work on high-skilled immigration. I start by describing the construction of the ethnic patenting records that I use in most of my studies. I then outline projects that have considered the economic consequences of high-skilled immigrants for the United States. The last part of this research summary focuses on the outbound economic consequences of high-skilled emigration for the home countries of those who move to the United States. Developing Data While the substantial role of immigrants in U.S. technological development has long been recognized, data constraints have posed a significant challenge for research. Some datasets, like the decennial Censuses, provide rich cross-sectional accounts but limited longitudinal variation. Others, such as the Current Population Survey, provide better longitudinal detail but less cross-sectional heterogeneity. Moreover, it has been especially difficult to collect data on the role of high-skilled immigrants in research-oriented firms and universities. Most of my work on high-skilled immigrants builds off the assignment of probable ethnicities to individuals who appear in U.S. patent records. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) publishes all the patents it grants, which have exceeded 200,000 grants in recent years. Every patent must list at least one inventor, and patents are allowed multiple inventors. Several features of patent litigation make it advisable to correctly list the identities of those truly doing the innovative work when filing for a patent, and through the assignment of patents, this inventor role can be separated from ownership of the property rights to the patent. I use the names of inventors to assign their probable ethnicities. This procedure exploits the fact that individuals with surnames of Gupta or Desai are likely to be Indian, Wang or Ming are likely to be Chinese, and Martinez or Rodriguez are likely to be Hispanic. Name matching procedures have been developed to provide probabilistic ethnicities for virtually all inventors in the USPTO system. The name approach is comparatively stronger at separating among Asian ethnic groups than among European or Hispanic names. This approach does not isolate immigration status directly for multiple reasons, but it does provide an indirect measure that proves useful in research. The appeal of this approach is that it permits assignment of ethnicities to individual patent records. With this granularity, the USPTO records can be aggregated in many ways, for example by year, by city, by very detailed technology codes, and by institution. Moreover, the patent data include a wealth of information, so one can, for example, study citations that patents make to other patents for evidence of ethnic networks in knowledge flow. One can also use measures developed in the technological change literature (such as patent originality scores) to compare inventor contributions across ethnicities. Figure 1 shows the tremendous increase in the ethnic contribution of U.S. inventors over the last 30 years, focusing only on inventors residing in the United States at the time of their work. The contribution of Chinese and Indian ethnic inventors displays exceptional growth, increasing from under 2 percent each to 9 percent and 6 percent respectively. Ethnic contributions are disproportionately concentrated in high-tech fields, and Figure 2 shows the Chinese and Indian inventor shares for several noteworthy companies. …",2013,12/22/2013,3,William R.

Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012,,"We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms.
