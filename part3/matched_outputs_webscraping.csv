Household Wealth and Entrepreneurial Career Choices: Evidence from Climate Disasters,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3803436,"This study investigates how household wealth affects the human capital of startups, based on U.S. Census individual-level employment data, deed records, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Using floods as a wealth shock, a regression discontinuity analysis shows inundated residents are 7% less likely to work in startups relative to their neighbors outside the flood boundary, within a 0.1-mile-wide band. The effect is more pronounced for homeowners, consistent with the wealth effect. The career distortion leads to a significant long-run income loss, highlighting the importance of self-insurance for human capital allocation.",2024,2021-01-01,7.0,{'Xiao Cen'},,Entrepreneurship; Business; Economics; Labour economics; Demographic economics; Psychology; Finance,,article,Xiao Cen,,False,True,False,False,1390,Household Wealth and Entrepreneurial Career Choices: Evidence from Climate Disasters,100
The Impact of Immigration on Firms and Workers: Insights from the H-1B Lottery,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4431106,"We study how random variation in the availability of highly educated, foreign-born workers impacts firm performance and recruitment behavior. We combine two rich data sources: 1) administrative employer-employee matched data from the US Census Bureau; and 2) firm level information on the first large-scale H-1B visa lottery in 2007. Using an event-study approach, we find that lottery wins lead to increases in firm hiring of college-educated, immigrant labor along with increases in scale and survival. These effects are stronger for small, skill-intensive, and high-productivity firms that participate in the lottery. We do not find evidence for displacement of native-born, college-educated workers at the firm level, on net. However, this result masks dynamics among more specific subgroups of incumbents that we further elucidate.",2024,2023-01-01,14.0,"{'Nicolas Morales', 'Kevin Shih', 'Parag  Mahajan', 'Parag Mahajan', 'Mingyu Chen', 'Agostina Brinatti'}",,Lottery; Immigration; Business; Demographic economics; Labour economics; Economics; Political science; Law; Microeconomics,,article,Parag Mahajan,,True,True,False,False,1250,The Impact of Immigration on Firms and Workers: Insights from the H-1B Lottery,100
Grassroots Design Meets Grassroots Innovation: Rural Design Orientation and Firm Performance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.04.013,"The study of grassroots design—applying structured, creative processes to the usability or aesthetics of a product without input from professional design consultancies—remains under investigated. If design comprises a mediation between people and technology whereby technologies are made more accessible or more likely to delight, then the process by which new grassroots inventions are transformed into innovations valued in markets cannot be fully understood. This paper uses U.S. data on the design orientation of respondents in the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey linked to longitudinal data on the same firms to examine the association between design, innovation, and employment and payroll growth.

Temperature and Local Industry Concentration,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4533247,"We use plant-level data from the US Census of Manufacturers to study the short and long run effects of temperature on manufacturing activity. We document that temperature shocks significantly increase energy costs and lower the productivity of small manufacturing plants, while large plants are mostly unaffected. In US counties that experienced higher increases in average temperatures between the 1980s and the 2010s, these heterogeneous effects have led to higher concentration of manufacturing activity within large plants, and a reallocation of labor from small to large manufacturing establishments. We offer a preliminary discussion of potential mechanisms explaining why large manufacturing firms might be better equipped for long-run adaptation to climate change, including their ability to hedge across locations, easier access to finance, and higher managerial skills.",2023,2023-01-01,2.0,"{'Stefan Zeume', 'Qiping Xu', 'Jacopo Ponticelli'}",,Business,,article,Qiping Xu,,False,True,False,False,1433,Temperature and Local Industry Concentration,100
Antitrust Enforcement Increases Economic Activity,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31597,"We hand-collect and standardize information describing all 3,055 antitrust law suits brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) between 1971 and 2018. Using restricted establishment-level microdata from the U.S. Census, we compare the economic outcomes of a non-tradable industry in states targeted by DOJ antitrust lawsuits to outcomes of the same industry in other states that were not targeted. We document that DOJ antitrust enforcement actions permanently increase employment by 5.4% and business formation by 4.1%. Using an event-study design, we find (1) a sharp increase in payroll that exceeds the increase in employment, meaning that DOJ antitrust enforcement increases average wages, (2) an economically smaller increase in sales that is statistically insignificant, and (3) a precise increase in the labor share. While we cannot separately measure the quantity and price of output, the increase in production inputs (employment), together with a proportionally smaller increase in sales, strongly suggests that these DOJ antitrust enforcement actions increase the quantity of output and simultaneously decrease the price of output. Our results show that government antitrust enforcement leads to persistently higher levels of economic activity in targeted industries.",2023,2023-08-01,4.0,"{'Ekaterina Volkova', 'Jessica Jeffers', 'Ezra Karger', 'Ezra  Karger', 'Simcha Barkai', 'Tania Babina'}",,Enforcement; Business; Law and economics; Economics; Political science; Law,,report,Tania Babina,,False,True,False,False,1533,Antitrust Enforcement Increases Economic Activity,100
Research and/or Development? Financial Frictions and Innovation Investment,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31521,"U.S. firms have reduced their investment in scientific research (“R”) compared to product development (“D”), raising questions about the returns to each type of investment, and about the reasons for this shift. We use Census data that disaggregates “R” from “D” to study how US firms adjust their innovation investments in response to an external increase in funding cost. Companies with greater demand for refinancing during the 2008 financial crisis, made larger cuts to R&D investment. This reduction in R&D is achieved almost entirely by reducing investment in research. Development remains essentially unchanged. If other firms patenting similar technologies must refinance, however, then Development investment declines. We interpret the latter result as evidence of technological competition: firms are reluctant to cut Development expenditures when that could place them at a disadvantage compared to potential rivals.",2023,2023-08-01,8.0,"{'Filippo Mezzanotti', 'Timothy Simcoe'}",,Investment (military); Finance; Business; Financial system; Investment banking; Economics; Political science; Politics; Law,,report,Filippo Mezzanotti,,False,True,False,False,1439,Research and/or Development?

Eviction and Poverty in American Cities,https://doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2016.1205268,"More than two million U.S. households have an eviction case filed against them each year. Policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels are increasingly pursuing policies to reduce the number of evictions, citing harm to tenants and high public expenditures related to homelessness. We study the consequences of eviction for tenants using newly linked administrative data from two major urban areas: Cook County (which includes Chicago) and New York City. We document that prior to housing court, tenants experience declines in earnings and employment and increases in financial distress and hospital visits. These pre-trends pose a challenge for disentangling correlation and causation. To address this problem, we use an instrumental variables approach based on cases randomly assigned to judges of varying leniency. We find that an eviction order increases homelessness and hospital visits and reduces earnings, durable goods consumption, and access to credit in the first two years. Effects on housing and labor market outcomes are driven by impacts for female and Black tenants. In the longer-run, eviction increases indebtedness and reduces credit scores.",2023,2016-07-10,1328.0,"{'Winnie van Dijk', 'Nicholas Mader', 'Davin Reed', 'John Eric Humphries', 'Daniel Tannenbaum', 'Daniel  Tannenbaum', 'Robert A Collinson', 'Winnie  van Dijk', 'Robert Collinson'}",,Eviction; Rental housing; Renting; Poverty; For profit; Economics; Profit (economics); Sociology; Economic history; Political science; Economic growth; Finance; Law; Neoclassical economics,,article,Robert Collinson,,False,True,False,False,1678,Eviction and Poverty in America Cities,99
Managing Employee Retention Concerns: Evidence from U.S. Census Data,https://doi.org/10.2308/tar-2021-0363,"Using Census microdata on 14,000 manufacturing plants, we examine how firms man age employee retention concerns in response to local wage pressure. We validate our measure of employee retention concerns by documenting that plants respond with wage increases, and do so more when the employees’ human capital is higher. We doc ument substantial use of non-wage levers in response to retention concerns. Plants shift incentives to increase the likelihood that bonuses can be paid: performance target transparency declines, as does the use of localized performance metrics for bonuses. Furthermore, promotions become more meritocratic, ensuring key employees can be promoted and retained. Lastly, decision-making authority at the plant-level increases, offering more agency to local employees. We find evidence consistent with inequity aversion constraining the response to local wage pressure, and document spillovers in both wage and non-wage reactions across same-firm plants.",2023,2024-10-01,4.0,"{'James D.

Exploring New Ways to Classify Industries for Energy Analysis and Modeling,https://doi.org/10.2172/1893357,"Combustion, other emitting processes and fossil energy use outside the power sector have become urgent concerns given the United States’ commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Industry is an important end user of energy and relies on fossil fuels used directly for process heating and as feedstocks for a diverse range of applications. Fuel and energy use by industry is heterogeneous, meaning even a single product group can vary broadly in its production routes and associated energy use. In the United States, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) serves as the standard for statistical data collection and reporting. In turn, data based on NAICS are the foundation of most United States energy modeling. Thus, the effectiveness of NAICS at representing energy use is a limiting condition for current expansive planning to improve energy efficiency and alternatives to fossil fuels in industry. Facility-level data could be used to build more detail into heterogeneous sectors and thus supplement data from Bureau of the Census and U.S Energy Information Administration reporting at NAICS code levels but are scarce. This work explores alternative classification schemes for industry based on energy use characteristics and validates an approach to estimate facility-level energy use from publicly available greenhouse gas emissions data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The approaches in this study can facilitate understanding of current, as well as possible future, energy demand. First, current approaches to the construction of industrial taxonomies are summarized along with their usefulness for industrial energy modeling. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are then used to detect clusters in data reported from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Industrial Assessment Center program. Clusters of Industrial Assessment Center data show similar levels of correlation between energy use and explanatory variables as three-digit NAICS codes. Interestingly, the clusters each include a large cross section of NAICS codes, which lends additional support to the idea that NAICS may not be particularly suited for correlation between energy use and the variables studied. Fewer clusters are needed for the same level of correlation as shown in NAICS codes. Initial assessment shows a reasonable level of separation using support vector machines with higher than 80% accuracy, so machine learning approaches may be promising for further analysis. The IAC data is focused on smaller and medium-sized facilities and is biased toward higher energy users for a given facility type. Cladistics, an approach for classification developed in biology, is adapted to energy and process characteristics of industries. Cladistics applied to industrial systems seeks to understand the progression of organizations and technology as a type of evolution, wherein traits are inherited from previous systems but evolve due to the emergence of inventions and variations and a selection process driven by adaptation to pressures and favorable outcomes. A cladogram is presented for evolutionary directions in the iron and steel sector. Cladograms are a promising tool for constructing scenarios and summarizing directions of sectoral innovation. The cladogram of iron and steel is based on the drivers of energy use in the sector. Phylogenetic inference is similar to machine learning approaches as it is based on a machine-led search of the solution space, therefore avoiding some of the subjectivity of other classification systems. Our prototype approach for constructing an industry cladogram is based on process characteristics according to the innovation framework derived from Schumpeter to capture evolution in a given sector. The resulting cladogram represents a snapshot in time based on detailed study of process characteristics. This work could be an important tool for the design of scenarios for more detailed modeling. Cladograms reveal groupings of emerging or dominant processes and their implications in a way that may be helpful for policymakers and entrepreneurs, allowing them to see the larger picture, other good ideas, or competitors. Constructing a cladogram could be a good first step to analysis of many industries (e.g. nitrogenous fertilizer production, ethyl alcohol manufacturing), to understand their heterogeneity, emerging trends, and coherent groupings of related innovations. Finally, validation is performed for facility-level energy estimates from the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Facility-level data availability continues to be a major challenge for industrial modeling. The method outlined by (McMillan et al. 2016; McMillan and Ruth 2019) allows estimating of facility level energy use based on mandatory greenhouse gas reporting. The validation provided here is an important step for further use of this data for industrial energy modeling.",2022,2022-10-10,1.0,"{'Matt Doolin', 'Gale Boyd', 'Colin McMillan', 'Liz Wachs'}",,Fossil fuel; Greenhouse gas; Computer science; Process (computing); Data science; Environmental economics; Data mining; Engineering; Economics; Ecology; Waste management; Biology; Operating system,,report,Liz Wachs,,False,True,False,False,1583,Exploring New Ways to Classify Industries for Energy Analysis and Modeling,100
U.S. Market Concentration and Import Competition,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3847929,"Many studies have documented that market concentration has risen among U.S. firms in recent decades. In this paper, we show that this rise in concentration was accompanied by tougher product market competition due to the entry of foreign competitors. Using confidential census data covering the universe of all firm sales in the U.S. manufacturing sector, we find that rising import competition increased concentration among U.S. firms by reallocating sales from smaller to larger U.S. firms and by causing firm exit. However, this increase in concentration was counteracted by the expansion of foreign firms, which reduced domestic firms’ share of the U.S. market inclusive of foreign firms’ sales. We find that once the sales of foreign exporters are taken into account, U.S. marketconcentration in manufacturing was stable between 1992 and 2012.",2022,2021-01-01,16.0,"{'Sebastian Heise', 'Sebastian  Heise', 'Mary Amiti'}",,Competition (biology); Business; Economics; International economics; Biology; Ecology,,article,Sebastian Heise,,False,True,False,False,1449,U.S. Market Concentration and Import Competition,100

We then introduce a novel search-aided algorithm that significantly improves the matching results by 7% and 2.9% at the patent and the assignee level, respectively. Overall, we are able to match 88.2% and 80.1% of all U.S. patents and assignees respectively.
