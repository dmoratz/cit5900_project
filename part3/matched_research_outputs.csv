Task Trade and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2714864,"Do job characteristics modulate the relationship between import competition and the wages of workers who perform those jobs? This paper tests the claim that workers in occupations featuring highly routine tasks will be more vulnerable to low-wage country import competition. Using data from the US Census Bureau, we construct a pooled cross-section (1990, 2000, and 2007) of more than 1.6 million individuals linked to the establishment in which they work. Occupational measures of vulnerability to trade competition – routineness, analytic complexity, and interpersonal interaction on the job – are constructed using O*NET data. The linked employer-employee data allow us to model the effect of low-wage import competition on the wages of workers with different occupational characteristics. Our results show that low-wage country import competition is associated with lower wages for US workers holding jobs that are highly routine and less complex. For workers holding nonroutine and highly complex jobs, increased import competition is associated with higher wages. Finally, workers in occupations with the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal interaction see higher wages, while workers with medium-low levels of interpersonal interaction suffer lower wages with increased low-wage import competition. These findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for occupational characteristics to more fully understand the relationship between trade and wages, and suggest ways in which task trade vulnerable occupations can disadvantage workers even when their jobs remain onshore.",2016,2016-01-01,0,"{'David L.

"Estimates of Childhood Overweight and Obesity at the Region, State, and County Levels: A Multilevel Small-Area Estimation Approach",https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab176,"Local-level childhood overweight and obesity data are often used to implement and evaluate community programs, as well as allocate resources to combat overweight and obesity. The most current substate estimates of US childhood obesity use data collected in 2007. Using a spatial multilevel model and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated childhood overweight and obesity prevalence rates at the Census regional division, state, and county levels using small-area estimation with poststratification. A sample of 24,162 children aged 10-17 years was used to estimate a national overweight and obesity rate of 30.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.0%, 34.9%). There was substantial county-to-county variability (range, 7.0% to 80.9%), with 31 out of 3,143 counties having an overweight and obesity rate significantly different from the national rate. Estimates from counties located in the Pacific region had higher uncertainty than other regions, driven by a higher proportion of underrepresented sociodemographic groups. Child-level overweight and obesity was related to race/ethnicity, sex, parental highest education (P < 0.01 for all), county-level walkability (P = 0.03), and urban/rural designation (P = 0.02). Overweight and obesity remains a vital issue for US youth, with substantial area-level variability.

The Unbundling of Advertising Agency Services: An Economic Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1515/1546-5616.1164,"Abstract We address a puzzle surrounding the shift from bundling to unbundling of U.S. advertising agency services and the slow pace of change over several decades. We model an agency’s decision as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing a relationship with an agency and pecuniary economies of scale from media services provision. Using micro-data from the U.S. Census of Services for 1982-2007, we find agencies are more likely to unbundle with increasing size, diversification and higher media prices, and less likely with increasing age, larger media volume, and an interaction between media prices and volume.",2012,2012-12-03,8,"{'Alvin J.

"The Impact of Chinese Trade on U.S. Employment: The Good, The Bad, and The Apocryphal",,"Using establishment-level micro data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper studies the impact of Chinese import penetration on firm reorganization and relocation across local labor markets. We find three main results. First, the negative effect of Chinese import penetration on local manufacturing employment documented in the existing literature is driven primarily by large, importing firms that simultaneously expand employment in non-manufacturing. A third of this negative manufacturing effect is accounted for by establishments switching their reported industry affiliation to non-manufacturing. Second, the reorganization of firm activity occurs mainly away from production of machinery, electronics, and transportation equipment towards wholesale, professional services (including R&D), and management. Together, the results are indicative of a “Silicone Valley” story of offshoring according to which firms focus U.S. activities on research, design, and distribution but produce the actual goods abroad. Third, the reorganization of firm activity occurs unevenly across local labor markets.

Using new data on establishment activities in the Census of Wholesale Trade conducted by the US Bureau of the Census in 2002 and 2007, this paper provides evidence on so-called ""factoryless goods producers"" (FGPs) in the US economy. FGPs are formally in the wholesale sector but, unlike traditional wholesale establishments, FGPs design the goods they sell and coordinate the production activities. This paper documents the extent of FGPs in the wholesale sector and their employment, wages, productivity and output.

Using instrumental variables models that leverage Walmart’s predictable expansion pattern outward from corporate headquarters, we find that closer proximity to a Walmart Supercenter improves household and child food security, as measured by affirmative responses to a food insecurity questionnaire and an indicator for food insecurity.

Restructuring of the Financial Industry and Implications for Sources of Start-Up Capital for New Businesses in Nonmetropolitan Counties *,,"Historically, in small towns throughout rural America local banks had formed symbiotic relationships with local businesses. The flow of capital was lubricated by the personal relationships and trust that developed between local banks and business owners. However, over the past 20 years changes in interstate banking laws have led to a flurry of mergers and acquisitions resulting in a national consolidation of bank firms.1 This consolidation was followed by a proliferation of establishments at the local level, many of which were former independent and regional banks that serviced local businesses (Boot 2011; Devaney and Weber 1995; Berger and Udell 1995; Berger and Black 2007). Issues affecting the sources of financing are of interest to rural sociologists (Green 1984; 1986). At the core of research on civic community and socioeconomic well-being in rural communities is a strong, independent middle class consisting of local leaders, entrepreneurs, and local small business owners (Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998; Blanchard, Tolbert and Mencken 2012; Tolbert et al. 2002). Entrepreneurs need start-up capital to launch a new business. Likewise, current local business owners need access to capital to keep their businesses functioning, and to expand their operations (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Jarmin 2008; Black and Strahan 2002).In this research note we provide descriptive analyses of sources of financing for new business start-ups in nonmetropolitan counties using data from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO). We present data on the sources of start-up capital for new business in nonmetropolitan counties and propose that there is a distinct decline in the use of bank loans over the decades. We also document a potential increase in use of riskier alternative sources, including credit cards over the past 30 years. Our analysis is unique in that we use confidential tabulations of the 2007 SBO at the Census Research Data Center to compare nonmetropolitan businesses with metropolitan businesses and publically available national trends.2At issue are the implications of changes in banking laws, such as the 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act, beyond merger and acquisitions, and improvements in communications technology (Whaling 1996; Cetorelli and Strahan 2006), that have led to firm-level consolidation in traditional financial services industry over the last 30 years. While many believe that this has increased access to customers and capital for some, there are potentially significant implications for businesses started by local entrepreneurs (De Young, Glennon, and Nigro 2008; Kilkenny 2002; Shaffer and Collender 2008).BACKGROUNDThe banking industry has been one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Before 1994, local banks were protected against interstate and intrastate competition, as state legislatures decided which banks could establish branches and subsidiaries within the state. At the federal level, the banking industry was governed by two important pieces of legislation: the McFadden Act of 1927 and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act. These laws put severe restrictions on interstate banking, and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act required that all bank holding companies (BHCs) fall under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Omarova and Tahyar 2011).3 The 1956 legislation was intended to limit the spatial expansion of large banking groups and their monopolization of local credit markets. However, many BHCs managed to circumvent the interstate restrictions. In 1993, 42 states still prohibited interstate banking, but there was considerable interstate banking activity, just done extremely inefficiently (Nippani and Green 2002; Zou, Miller and Malamud 2011).The 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act sought to remove the inefficiencies and ease the interstate banking restrictions. The impact was argued to be beneficial for banks, businesses, and consumers. …",2016,2016-01-01,7,"{'F. Carson Mencken', 'Charles M.

Who are the people in my neighborhood?: The 'contextual fallacy' of measuring individual context with census geographies,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,"Scholars deploy census-based measures of neighborhood context throughout the social sciences and epidemiology. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy-a measure of ethno-racial diversity), we find that block-level Census statistics frequently do not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales. Finally, we show that within-unit variation is greater in some parts of the country than in others. We publish county-level estimates of the SDIC statistics that enable scholars to assess whether mis-specification in context variables is likely to alter analytic findings when measured at any of the three common Census units.",2018,2018-02-14,7,"{'Nathan Frey', 'Nicholas N.

The Impacts of Opportunity Zones on Zone Residents,,"Created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, the Opportunity Zone program was designed to encourage investment in distressed communities across the U.S. We examine the early impacts of the Opportunity Zone program on residents of targeted areas. We leverage restricted-access microdata from the American Community Survey and employ difference-in-differences and matching approaches to estimate causal reduced-form effects of the program. Our results point to modest, if any, positive effects of the Opportunity Zone program on the employment, earnings, or poverty of zone residents.

Combining worker data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset, detailed establishment information from the Census of Manufactures, and transaction-level trade data, we find that rising import competition from China and other developing economies increases the likelihood of job loss among manufacturing workers with less than a high school degree; it is not significantly related to job losses for workers with at least a college degree.",2016,2016-01-01,7,"{'David L.

The Shifting of the Property Tax on Urban Renters: Evidence from New York State’s Homestead Tax Option,,"In 1981, New York State enabled their cities to adopt the Homestead Tax Option (HTO), which created a multi-tiered property tax system for rental properties in New York City, Buffalo, and Rochester. The HTO enabled these municipalities to impose a higher property tax rate on rental units in buildings with four or more units, compared to rental units in buildings with three or fewer units. Using restricted-use American Housing Survey data and historical property tax rates from each of these cities, we exploit within-unit across-time variation in property tax rates and rents to estimate the degree to which property taxes are shifted onto renters in the form of higher rents. We find that property owners shift approximately 14 percent of an increase in taxes onto renters. This study is the first to use within-unit across time variation in property taxes and rents to identify this shifting effect. Our estimated effect is measurably smaller than most previous studies, which often found shifting effects of over 60 percent.",2020,2020-01-01,2,"{'John Ýinger', 'David Schwegman'}",,"Housing Market and Economics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,David Schwegman,https://openalex.org/A5075828626,FSRDC; American Housing Survey; Cornell RDC; Census Bureau,American Housing Survey,Cornell,1484,The Shifting of the Property Tax on Urban Renters: Evidence from New York State’s Homestead Tax Option,100

Activists decried this injustice and pressured legislators to introduce new practices and procedures. Since the passage of these initiatives in the 1960s, scholars have repeatedly documented ongoing racial inequality in housing at large. Yet rarely have researchers investigated whether racial inequality persists within governmentally subsidized housing units. By merging the restricted American Housing Survey with the American Community Survey at a Federal Statistical Research Data Center, the authors find that low-income renter subsidies are effective and beneficial but disproportionately grant White residents access to cheaper and higher quality units.

Reservation Nonemployer and Employer Establishments: Data from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Databases,,"The presence of businesses on American Indian reservations has been difficult to analyze due to limited data. Akee, Mykerezi, and Todd (AMT; 2017) geocoded confidential data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database to identify whether employer establishments were located on or off American Indian reservations and then compared federally recognized reservations and nearby county areas with respect to their per capita number of employers and jobs. We use their methods and the U.S. Census Integrated Longitudinal Business Database to develop parallel results for nonemployer establishments and for the combination of employer and nonemployer establishments. Similar to AMT’s findings, we find that reservations and nearby county areas have a similar sectoral distribution of nonemployer and nonemployer-plus-employer establishments, but reservations have significantly fewer of them in nearly all sectors, especially when the area population is below 15,000. By contrast to AMT, the average size of reservation nonemployer establishments, as measured by revenue (instead of the jobs measure AMT used for employers), is smaller than the size of nonemployers in nearby county areas, and this is true in most industries as well. The most significant exception is in the retail sector. Geographic and demographic factors, such as population density and per capita income, statistically account for only a small portion of these differences. However, when we assume that nonemployer establishments create the equivalent of one job and use combined employer-plus-nonemployer jobs to measure establishment size, the employer job numbers dominate and we parallel AMT’s finding that, due to large job counts in the Arts/Entertainment/Recreation and Public Administration sectors, reservations on average have slightly more jobs per resident than nearby county areas.",2018,2018-12-01,0,"{'Elton Mykerezi', 'Richard M.

Controlling for both individual‐ and neighborhood‐level conditions, our findings indicate that within traditional immigrant counties, rates of violence reporting in immigrant neighborhoods are similar to those observed elsewhere. In contrast, within newer immigrant destinations, we observe much lower rates of violence reporting in neighborhoods with a large concentration of immigrants.

By using the 2008–2012 area‐identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), we evaluate the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration on individual violence risk across race/ethnicity and labor market stratification factors in areas with different histories of immigration. The results of our analysis reveal three key patterns. First, we find a consistent protective role of immigrant concentration that is not weakened by low education, low income, unemployment, or labor market competition. Therefore, even economically disadvantaged people enjoy the crime‐reduction benefit of immigration. Second, we find support for threshold models that predict a nonlinear, stronger protective role of immigrant concentration on violence at higher levels of immigrant concentration. The protective function of immigration also is higher in areas of longer histories of immigration. Third, compared with Blacks and Whites, Latinos receive a greater violence‐reduction benefit of immigrant concentration possibly because they live in closer proximity with immigrants and share common sociocultural features. Nevertheless, immigrant concentration yields a diminishing return in reducing Latino victimization as immigrants approach a near‐majority of neighborhood residents.

Predictive Analytics and Organizational Architecture: Plant-Level Evidence from Census Data,,"We examine trends in the use of predictive analytics for a sample of more than 25,000 manufacturing plants using proprietary data from the US Census Bureau. Comparing 2010 and 2015, we find that use of predictive analytics has increased markedly, with the greatest use in younger plants, professionally-managed firms, more educated workforces, and stable industries. Decisions on data to be gathered originate from headquarters and are associated with less delegation of decision-making and more widespread awareness of quantitative targets among plant employees. Performance targets become more accurate, long-term oriented, and linked to company-wide performance, and management incentives strengthen, both in terms of monetary bonuses and career outcomes.

Restructuring of the Financial Industry and Implications for Sources of Start-Up Capital for New Businesses in Nonmetropolitan Counties *,,"Historically, in small towns throughout rural America local banks had formed symbiotic relationships with local businesses. The flow of capital was lubricated by the personal relationships and trust that developed between local banks and business owners. However, over the past 20 years changes in interstate banking laws have led to a flurry of mergers and acquisitions resulting in a national consolidation of bank firms.1 This consolidation was followed by a proliferation of establishments at the local level, many of which were former independent and regional banks that serviced local businesses (Boot 2011; Devaney and Weber 1995; Berger and Udell 1995; Berger and Black 2007). Issues affecting the sources of financing are of interest to rural sociologists (Green 1984; 1986). At the core of research on civic community and socioeconomic well-being in rural communities is a strong, independent middle class consisting of local leaders, entrepreneurs, and local small business owners (Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998; Blanchard, Tolbert and Mencken 2012; Tolbert et al. 2002). Entrepreneurs need start-up capital to launch a new business. Likewise, current local business owners need access to capital to keep their businesses functioning, and to expand their operations (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Jarmin 2008; Black and Strahan 2002).In this research note we provide descriptive analyses of sources of financing for new business start-ups in nonmetropolitan counties using data from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO). We present data on the sources of start-up capital for new business in nonmetropolitan counties and propose that there is a distinct decline in the use of bank loans over the decades. We also document a potential increase in use of riskier alternative sources, including credit cards over the past 30 years. Our analysis is unique in that we use confidential tabulations of the 2007 SBO at the Census Research Data Center to compare nonmetropolitan businesses with metropolitan businesses and publically available national trends.2At issue are the implications of changes in banking laws, such as the 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act, beyond merger and acquisitions, and improvements in communications technology (Whaling 1996; Cetorelli and Strahan 2006), that have led to firm-level consolidation in traditional financial services industry over the last 30 years. While many believe that this has increased access to customers and capital for some, there are potentially significant implications for businesses started by local entrepreneurs (De Young, Glennon, and Nigro 2008; Kilkenny 2002; Shaffer and Collender 2008).BACKGROUNDThe banking industry has been one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Before 1994, local banks were protected against interstate and intrastate competition, as state legislatures decided which banks could establish branches and subsidiaries within the state. At the federal level, the banking industry was governed by two important pieces of legislation: the McFadden Act of 1927 and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act. These laws put severe restrictions on interstate banking, and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act required that all bank holding companies (BHCs) fall under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Omarova and Tahyar 2011).3 The 1956 legislation was intended to limit the spatial expansion of large banking groups and their monopolization of local credit markets. However, many BHCs managed to circumvent the interstate restrictions. In 1993, 42 states still prohibited interstate banking, but there was considerable interstate banking activity, just done extremely inefficiently (Nippani and Green 2002; Zou, Miller and Malamud 2011).The 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act sought to remove the inefficiencies and ease the interstate banking restrictions. The impact was argued to be beneficial for banks, businesses, and consumers. …",2016,2016-01-01,7,"{'F. Carson Mencken', 'Charles M.

Preliminary Analysis of the Distributions of Carbon and Energy Intensity for 27 Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industrial Sectors,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1925133,"It is well documented that different manufacturing sectors require different amounts of energy. Primary materials conversion, e.g., iron ore and scrap into steel, limestone and sand into cement and glass, or wood and other fibers into paper, tend to be the most energy-intensive in the production process, while final consumer products like electronics and clothing require the least energy. This leads to something like the 80-20 rule, where a large portion of energy use is in a small number of industries. For example, the 2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) reported that 75 percent of fuel use arises from only five of the 21 three-digit industries, using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These five sectors are a small share of the total U.S. economy. The energy intensity for different industrial sectors is easily measured using published government statistics, but the plants within these industries are not homogeneous entities. This report measures the differences in energy use and associated CO2 emissions as a first step to understanding the within-sector heterogeneity of energy use.",2011,2011-01-01,1,"{'Béla Személy', 'Tatyana Kuzmenko', 'Gang Zhang', 'Gale Boyd'}",Duke University; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Boston University; Quest University Canada,"Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies; Vehicle emissions and performance",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Gale A Boyd,https://openalex.org/A5058981904,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes; Census of Mining; Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,Triangle,422,Preliminary Analysis of the Distributions of Carbon and Energy Intensity for 27 Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industrial Sectors,100
File Matching with Faulty Continuous Matching Variables,,"We present LFCMV, a Bayesian file linking methodology designed to link records using continuous matching variables in situations where we do not expect values of these matching variables to agree exactly across matched pairs. The method involves a linking model for the distance between the matching variables of records in one file and the matching variables of their linked records in the second. This linking model is conditional on a vector indicating the links. We specify a mixture model for the distance component of the linking model, as this latent structure allows the distance between matching variables in linked pairs to vary across types of linked pairs. Finally, we specify a model for the linking vector. We describe the Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of this linkage model and use artificial data to illustrate model performance. We also introduce a linking application using public survey information and data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures and use LFCMV to link the records.",2017,2017-01-01,0,"{'Nicole M.

The Energy Efficiency Gap and Energy Price Responsiveness in Food Processing,,"This paper estimates stochastic frontier energy demand functions with non-public, plant-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau to measure the energy efficiency gap and energy price elasticities in the food processing industry. The estimates are for electricity and fuel use in 4 food processing sectors, based on the disaggregation of this industry used by the National Energy Modeling System Industrial Demand Module. The estimated demand functions control for plant inputs and output, energy prices, and other observables including 6-digit NAICS industry designations. Own price elasticities range from 0.6 to -0.9 with little evidence of fuel/electricity substitution. The magnitude of the efficiency estimates is sensitive to the assumptions but consistently reveal that few plants achieve 100% efficiency. Defining a “practical level of energy efficiency” as the 95th percentile of the efficiency distributions and averaging across all the models result in a ~20% efficiency gap. However, most of the potential reductions in energy use from closing this efficiency gap are from plants that are “low hanging fruit”; 13% of the 20% potential reduction in the efficiency gap can be obtained by bringing the lower half of the efficiency distribution up to just the median level of observed performance. New plants do exhibit higher energy efficiency than existing plants which is statistically significant, but the difference is small for most of the industry; ranging from a low of 0.4% to a high of 5.7%.",2020,2020-06-01,3,"{'Matt Doolin', 'Gale Boyd'}",,"Energy Efficiency and Management; Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Gale A Boyd,https://openalex.org/A5058981904,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Triangle,1582,The Energy Efficiency Gap and Energy Price Responsiveness in Food Processing,100

The decrease in wages persists (at least) for five years post-bankruptcy. The present value of wage losses summed up to five years after bankruptcy amounts to 29-49% of the average pre-bankruptcy market value of firm.

"Firm Reorganization, Chinese Imports, and US Manufacturing Employment",,"What is the impact of Chinese imports on employment of US manufacturing firms? Previous papers have found a negative effect of Chinese imports on employment in US manufacturing establishments, industries, and regions. However, I show theoretically and empirically that the impact of offshoring on firms, which can be thought of as collections of establishments – differs from the impact on individual establishments - because offshoring reduces costs at the firm level. These cost reductions can result in firms expanding their total manufacturing employment in industries in which the US has a comparative advantage relative to China, even as specific establishments within the firm shrink. Using novel data on firms from the US Census Bureau, I show that the data support this view: US firms expanded manufacturing employment as reorganization toward less exposed industries in response to increased Chinese imports in US output and input markets allowed them to reduce the cost of production. More exposed firms expanded employment by 2 percent more per year as they hired more (i) production workers in manufacturing, whom they paid higher wages, and (ii) in services complementary to high-skilled and high-tech manufacturing, such as R&D, design, engineering, and headquarters services. In other words, although Chinese imports may have reduced employment within some establishments, these losses were more than offset by gains in employment within the same firms. Contrary to conventional wisdom, firms exposed to greater Chinese imports created more manufacturing and nonmanufacturing jobs than non-exposed firms.",2017,2017-01-01,22,{'Ildikó Magyari'},,Global trade and economics; Firm Innovation and Growth; Economic Growth and Productivity,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Ildiko Magyari,https://openalex.org/A5089775314,Census Bureau; Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File; Census of Manufactures,Census Bureau,Baruch,1120,"Firm Reorganization, Chinese Imports, and US Manufacturing Employment",100

The Unbundling of Advertising Agency Services: An Economic Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1515/1546-5616.1164,"Abstract We address a puzzle surrounding the shift from bundling to unbundling of U.S. advertising agency services and the slow pace of change over several decades. We model an agency’s decision as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing a relationship with an agency and pecuniary economies of scale from media services provision. Using micro-data from the U.S. Census of Services for 1982-2007, we find agencies are more likely to unbundle with increasing size, diversification and higher media prices, and less likely with increasing age, larger media volume, and an interaction between media prices and volume.",2012,2012-12-03,8,"{'Alvin J.

Leapfrogging the Melting Pot?

"Estimates of Childhood Overweight and Obesity at the Region, State, and County Levels: A Multilevel Small-Area Estimation Approach",https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab176,"Local-level childhood overweight and obesity data are often used to implement and evaluate community programs, as well as allocate resources to combat overweight and obesity. The most current substate estimates of US childhood obesity use data collected in 2007. Using a spatial multilevel model and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated childhood overweight and obesity prevalence rates at the Census regional division, state, and county levels using small-area estimation with poststratification. A sample of 24,162 children aged 10-17 years was used to estimate a national overweight and obesity rate of 30.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.0%, 34.9%). There was substantial county-to-county variability (range, 7.0% to 80.9%), with 31 out of 3,143 counties having an overweight and obesity rate significantly different from the national rate. Estimates from counties located in the Pacific region had higher uncertainty than other regions, driven by a higher proportion of underrepresented sociodemographic groups. Child-level overweight and obesity was related to race/ethnicity, sex, parental highest education (P < 0.01 for all), county-level walkability (P = 0.03), and urban/rural designation (P = 0.02). Overweight and obesity remains a vital issue for US youth, with substantial area-level variability.

Earnings Responses to Increases in Payroll Taxes,,"This paper uses SIPP data matched to longitudinal uncapped earnings records from the Social Security Administration for 1981 to 1999 in order to analyze earnings responses to increases in tax rates and inform discussions about the likely effects of raising the Social Security taxable maximum. The earnings distribution of workers around the current taxable maximum is inconsistent with an annual model in which people are highly responsive to the payroll tax rate, even in the subset of self-employed individuals. Panel data on married men with high earnings display a tremendous increase in earnings over the 1980s and 1990s relative to other groups, with no clear breaks around the key tax reforms. This suggests that other income groups cannot serve as a control group for the high earners. Our analysis does not support the finding of a large behavioral response to taxation by wives of high earners. We actually find a decrease in the labor supply of wives of high earners around both the 1986 and the 1993 tax reforms, which we attribute to an income effect due to the surge in primary earnings at the top. Policy simulations suggest that with an earnings elasticity of 0.5, lost income tax revenue and increased deadweight loss would swamp any benefits from the increase in payroll tax revenue. In contrast, with an elasticity of 0.2, the ratio of the gain in OASDI revenue to lost income tax revenue and deadweight loss would be much greater.

File Matching with Faulty Continuous Matching Variables,,"We present LFCMV, a Bayesian file linking methodology designed to link records using continuous matching variables in situations where we do not expect values of these matching variables to agree exactly across matched pairs. The method involves a linking model for the distance between the matching variables of records in one file and the matching variables of their linked records in the second. This linking model is conditional on a vector indicating the links. We specify a mixture model for the distance component of the linking model, as this latent structure allows the distance between matching variables in linked pairs to vary across types of linked pairs. Finally, we specify a model for the linking vector. We describe the Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of this linkage model and use artificial data to illustrate model performance.

Workersʼ Decisions to Take-Up Offered Health Insurance Coverage: Assessing the Importance of Out-of-Pocket Premium Costs,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200307007-00005,"Background. Many proposed policy initiatives involve subsidies directed toward encouraging employers to offer coverage and toward workers to encourage enrollment in offered plans. Given that insurance coverage reflects employers' decisions to offer coverage, eligibility requirements for such coverage, and employees' take-up decisions, all three elements are important when considering mechanisms to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. Research Design. In this study, we examine the relationship between workers' decisions to take-up offers of health insurance and annual out-of-pocket contributions, total premiums, and employer and workforce characteristics. We model the take-up decision using cross-sectional data from approximately 18,000 establishments per year from the 1997 to 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component. Results. We find that workers are less likely to enroll in coverage as single employee contributions increase. Our results for family contributions are much smaller than for single contributions and are not statistically significant in all years. Our simulation results suggest that reducing employee contribution levels for single coverage from existing levels in 1999 to zero would yield an increase in take-up rates of roughly 6% points in establishments that had required a positive level of contributions. Our results also indicate that of the 13.8 million private sector workers who decline coverage from their employers, 2.5 million would potentially enroll in employer-sponsored coverage if the cost of single coverage were to fall to zero.

Are Mutual Fund Managers Paid for Performance? Evidence from U.S. Administrative Earnings Data,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4658990,"We study the determinants of compensation for portfolio managers in the U.S. mutual fund industry using administrative data on worker-level earnings from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that the average portfolio manager's pay is $1.76 million in 2020 dollars and a clear skew toward the right tail of the distribution. More importantly, we document a strong pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) for portfolio managers. For instance, a 1% increase in the average abnormal return of the past three, five, and ten years increases an average manager's pay by 5.3%, 7.8%, and 10.3%, respectively. Furthermore, we also investigate the economic rationale for the performance incentives we document in portfolio manager pay. We find that portfolio managers' compensation is strongly correlated with the expected fee revenue they generate for investment advisors via the flow-performance relationship.

Estimating the Job Impacts of Environmental Regulation,https://doi.org/10.1017/bca.2015.14,"In the face of strong policy interest in the possible regulation–jobs linkage and weak analytical evidence to support a generalizable conclusion, what should a regulatory agency like the Environmental Protection Agency do in a regulatory impact analysis (RIA)? Initially, an RIA should start with a clear concept of what the regulatory agency is trying to estimate. Much of the popular debate is looking for a total job effect. Yet one thing we do know is that, in aggregate, there will not be a net job change unless the economy deviates from its normal rate of full employment. The gist of our literature review suggests that looking to historic data for stable statistical relationships between regulatory spending and job changes, even in a single industry, is tenuous at best. However, the intuition is relatively easy to trace out with certain assumptions: (1) added costs imply added activity that entails added jobs; (2) higher product prices or other regulatory limits imply less production that entails fewer jobs. Taking an average employment rate per dollar of relevant economic activity, coupled with an assumed demand elasticity, these effects can be multiplied out into job changes, although such simple calculations must be tested by validating key assumptions or exploring the estimates sensitivity to alternatives. New estimates by Belova, Gray, Linn and Morgenstern [(2013a). Environmental Regulation And Industry Employment: A Reassessment . Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau Discussion Paper, CES 1336, July.] indicate that extending and expanding the widely cited approach by Morgenstern, Pizer and Shih [(2002). Jobs Versus the Environment: An Industry-Level Perspective. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 43 , 412–436] is unlikely to be successful.

US Decennial Census return rates: the role of social capital,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijse-07-2018-0377,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess whether additional information about a community’s level of social capital can help to better predict a return rate from that area, in order to better target resources to improve mail-in responses. Design/methodology/approach Two-sample two-stage least squares is used to apply determinants of six different measures of social capital from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey to observations in the Decennial Census (DC) which are then aggregated to the census tract level. The probability of a census tract having a high level of each social capital measure is estimated. Multivariate regression is used to identify the importance of high community social capital for predicting census mail-in return rates. Findings The analysis reveals that a higher level of trust contributes the most to increasing return rates and a high level of political activism decreases return rates. Additionally, higher levels of sociability contribute negatively to DC return rates, which is consistent with sociability being linked to a more insular (i.e. family and friends) focus. Practical implications While contributing statistically significantly to the predictability of census tract response rates, the cost of acquiring measures of social capital for each census tract may not to be viewed worth the gain in predictive power. Social implications Higher levels of trust contribute positively to survey participation, suggesting that any social, economic or political environment that diminishes trust will undercut civic engagement. Political activism and (insular) sociability decrease participation.

Displaced and unsafe: The legacy of settler-colonial racial capitalism in the U.S. rental market,https://doi.org/10.1080/26884674.2023.2176799,"Unsafe rental units are disproportionately located in communities of color, resulting in numerous detrimental effects for residents' health and socioeconomic well-being. Yet, scholars disagree regarding the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Exogenous capitalism theories emphasize socioeconomic factors while setter-colonial racial capitalism theories emphasize the racist policies and practices that incentivize unequal investment and maintenance.

Displaced and unsafe: The legacy of settler-colonial racial capitalism in the U.S. rental market,https://doi.org/10.1080/26884674.2023.2176799,"Unsafe rental units are disproportionately located in communities of color, resulting in numerous detrimental effects for residents' health and socioeconomic well-being.

Exogenous capitalism theories emphasize socioeconomic factors while setter-colonial racial capitalism theories emphasize the racist policies and practices that incentivize unequal investment and maintenance.

Still Separate and Unequal: Persistent Racial Segregation and Inequality in Subsidized Housing,https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231192389,"Initially, U.S. federally funded low-income rental housing was racially segregated and unequal. Activists decried this injustice and pressured legislators to introduce new practices and procedures. Since the passage of these initiatives in the 1960s, scholars have repeatedly documented ongoing racial inequality in housing at large. Yet rarely have researchers investigated whether racial inequality persists within governmentally subsidized housing units. By merging the restricted American Housing Survey with the American Community Survey at a Federal Statistical Research Data Center, the authors find that low-income renter subsidies are effective and beneficial but disproportionately grant White residents access to cheaper and higher quality units. Moreover, subsidized renters remain racially segregated across program type and neighborhoods. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for future research and policy decisions.",2023,2023-01-01,2,"{'Junia Howell', 'Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn', 'Ellen Whitehead'}",University of Illinois Chicago; Ball State University; Washington University in St. Louis,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing Market and Economics; Housing, Finance, and Neoliberalism",Socius Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,article,Junia Howell,https://openalex.org/A5002223560,American Housing Survey; Commercial CoreLogic Buildings; Commercial CoreLogic Tax,American Housing Survey,Penn State,1518,Still Separate and Unequal: Persistent Racial Segregation and Inequality in Subsidized Housing,100
Leapfrogging the Melting Pot? European Immigrants' Intergenerational Mobility across the Twentieth Century,https://doi.org/10.15195/v8.a23,"During the early twentieth century, industrial-era European immigrants entered the United States with lower levels of education than the U.S. average.

Are Mutual Fund Managers Paid for Performance? Evidence from U.S. Administrative Earnings Data,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4658990,"We study the determinants of compensation for portfolio managers in the U.S. mutual fund industry using administrative data on worker-level earnings from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that the average portfolio manager's pay is $1.76 million in 2020 dollars and a clear skew toward the right tail of the distribution. More importantly, we document a strong pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) for portfolio managers. For instance, a 1% increase in the average abnormal return of the past three, five, and ten years increases an average manager's pay by 5.3%, 7.8%, and 10.3%, respectively. Furthermore, we also investigate the economic rationale for the performance incentives we document in portfolio manager pay. We find that portfolio managers' compensation is strongly correlated with the expected fee revenue they generate for investment advisors via the flow-performance relationship.

We establish five stylized facts that are relevant for the extent of granularity and the nature of growth in the U.S. economy: (1) with an estimated shape parameter significantly below 1, the best-fitting Pareto distribution substantially differs from Zipf's law for both firms and establishments; (2) a lognormal distribution fits both establishment and firm size distributions better than the commonly-used Pareto distribution, even far in the upper tail; (3) a convolution of lognormal and Pareto distributions fits both size distributions better than lognormal alone while also providing a better fit for the employment share distribution; (4) the estimated parameters are different across manufa cturing and services sectors, but the distribution fit ranking remains unchanged in the sectoral subsamples.

"Heavy Tailed, but not Zipf: Firm and Establishment Size in the U.S",,"Heavy tails play an important role in modern macroeconomics and international economics. Previous work often assumes a Pareto distribution for firm size, typically with a shape parameter approaching Zipf’s law. This convenient approximation has dramatic consequences for the importance of large firms in the economy. But we show that a lognormal distribution, or better yet, a convolution of a lognormal and a non-Zipf Pareto distribution, provides a better description of the U.S. economy, using confidential Census Bureau data. These findings hold even far in the upper tail and suggest heterogeneous firm models should more systematically explore deviations from Zipf’s law.",2021,2021-01-01,2,"{'Andrea Stella', 'Illenin Kondo', 'Logan T.

Use of Freight Production Functions to Identify Outliers in the Commodity Flow Survey Data,,"This research aims at analyzing the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data across various years (1993, 1997, and 2007), develop methodologies to identify outliers, and to improve freight planning and modeling to help in policy development to make the freight system more efficient and sustainable. To this end, the team has developed freight production models that estimate the amount (in pounds per year) of cargo produced by the firms as a function of number of employees, industry sector, and geography. Using the most significant model the firms that behave eccentric with respect to freight compared to other firms in the same industry (at 2 digit North American Industry Classification System, NAICS) were identified. The results are presented in the form of summary tables showing the total number of firms, number of outliers per industry sector and percentage of outliers per industry sector. The results show that there is a need for further exploration into current sample and survey design to ensure realistic coverage of the variations in the predominant freight indicators such as firm size, sector, and geography.",2017,2017-01-01,0,"{'José Holguín‐Veras', 'Lokesh Kalahasthi', 'Shama Campbell'}",,Urban and Freight Transport Logistics; Maritime Ports and Logistics; Logistics and Infrastructure Analysis,,article,Lokesh Kalahasthi,https://openalex.org/A5035256689,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Commodity Flow Survey; Baruch RDC; Census Bureau,Commodity Flow Survey,Baruch,709,Use of Freight Production Functions to Identify Outliers in the Commodity Flow Survey Data,100
Brighter Prospects? Assessing the Franchise Advantage using Census Data,,"This paper uses Census micro data to examine how starting a business as a franchise rather than an independent business affects its survival and growth prospects. We first consider the factors that influence the business owner's decision about being franchised, and then use different empirical approaches to correct for selection bias in our performance analyses. We find that franchised businesses on average benefit from higher survival rates and faster initial growth relative to independent businesses. However, the effects are not large and, conditional on first-year survival, the differences basically disappear. We briefly discuss potential mechanisms to explain these results. U.S. Census Bureau.

Predictive Analytics and Organizational Architecture: Plant-Level Evidence from Census Data,,"We examine trends in the use of predictive analytics for a sample of more than 25,000 manufacturing plants using proprietary data from the US Census Bureau. Comparing 2010 and 2015, we find that use of predictive analytics has increased markedly, with the greatest use in younger plants, professionally-managed firms, more educated workforces, and stable industries. Decisions on data to be gathered originate from headquarters and are associated with less delegation of decision-making and more widespread awareness of quantitative targets among plant employees. Performance targets become more accurate, long-term oriented, and linked to company-wide performance, and management incentives strengthen, both in terms of monetary bonuses and career outcomes. Plants increasing predictive analytics become more efficient, with lower inventory, increased volume of shipments, narrower product mix, reduced management payroll and increased use of flexible and temporary employees.

We use a novel two-dimensional propensity score matching method to construct quasi-experimental data from repeated-cross-sectional data that provide rich individual characteristics and fine-geographical-resolution block information, generating four subgroups from the sample jointly defined by before-after station opening and treatment-control. We compare changes to the four subgroups' commuting mode choice, commuting time, and commuting schedule. The results indicate that new transit lines lead to 10%, 6%, and insignificant increases in public transportation ridership for Charlotte, Dalla, and Los Angeles, respectively.

Making a Motivated Manager: A Census Data Investigation into Efficiency Differences Between Franchisee and Franchisor-Owned Restaurants,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2883267,"A central theme in much of the franchising literature is that franchising mitigates the principle-agent problems between the owner of the franchise company and the operator of the local establishment by making the operator the owner-franchisee of the establishment. Despite the centrality of that assumption in the literature, there is little empirical evidence to support it. We use Census of Retail Trade data for essentially all full- and limited-service restaurants in the US to test whether franchisee ownership affects performance at the establishment level.

The Effects of Environmental Regulation on the Competitiveness of U.S. Manufacturing,,"The economic costs of environmental regulations have been widely debated since the U.S. began to restrict pollution emissions more than four decades ago.

Making a Motivated Manager: A Census Data Investigation into Efficiency Differences Between Franchisee and Franchisor-Owned Restaurants,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2883267,"A central theme in much of the franchising literature is that franchising mitigates the principle-agent problems between the owner of the franchise company and the operator of the local establishment by making the operator the owner-franchisee of the establishment.

We use Census of Retail Trade data for essentially all full- and limited-service restaurants in the US to test whether franchisee ownership affects performance at the establishment level.

We model an agency’s decision as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing a relationship with an agency and pecuniary economies of scale from media services provision. Using micro-data from the U.S. Census of Services for 1982-2007, we find agencies are more likely to unbundle with increasing size, diversification and higher media prices, and less likely with increasing age, larger media volume, and an interaction between media prices and volume.",2012,2012-12-03,8,"{'Alvin J.

What Happens When Firms Patent? New Evidence from U.S. Economic Census Data,,"In this study, we present novel statistics on the patenting in US manufacturing and new evidence on the question of what happens when firms patent. We do so by creating a comprehensive firm-patent matched dataset that links the NBER patent data (covering the universe of patents) to firm data from the US Census Bureau (which covers the universe of all firms with paid employees). Our linked dataset covers more than 48,000 unique assignees (compared to about 4,100 assignees covered by the Compustat-NBER link), representing almost two-thirds of all non-individual, non-university, non-government assignees from 1975 to 1997. We use the data to present some basic but novel statistics on the role of patenting in US manufacturing, including strong evidence confirming the highly skewed nature of patenting activity. Next, we examine what happens when firms patent by looking at a large sample of first time patentees. We find that while there are significant cross-sectional differences in size and total factor productivity between patentee firms and non-patentee firms, changes in patentownership status within firms is associated with a contemporaneous and substantial increase in firm size, but little to no change in total factor productivity. This evidence suggests that patenting is associated with firm growth through new product innovations (firm scope) rather than through reduction in the cost of producing existing products (firm productivity). Consistent with this explanation, we find that when firms patent, there is a contemporaneous increase in the number of products that the firms produce. Estimates of (within-firm) elasticity of firm characteristics to patent stock confirm our results. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of size and productivity, and to various sample selection criteria.",2008,2008-01-01,2,"{'Natarajan Balasubramanian', 'Jagadeesh Sivadasan'}",Whitman College; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,Firm Innovation and Growth; Intellectual Property and Patents; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Natarajan N Balasubramanian,https://openalex.org/A5054069581,Survey of Industrial Research and Development; Service Annual Survey; Foreign Trade Data - Import; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Michigan,209,What Happens When Firms Patent?

We find that learning rates vary considerably among industries and are higher in industries with greater R&D, advertising, and capital intensity. More importantly, we find that higher rates of learning are associated with wider dispersion of Tobin’s q and profitability among firms in the industry. Together, these findings suggest that learning intensity represents an important characteristic of the industry environment.",2006,2006-12-01,0,"{'Natarajan Balasubramanian', 'Marvin B.

Who are the people in my neighborhood?: The 'contextual fallacy' of measuring individual context with census geographies,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,"Scholars deploy census-based measures of neighborhood context throughout the social sciences and epidemiology. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy-a measure of ethno-racial diversity), we find that block-level Census statistics frequently do not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales. Finally, we show that within-unit variation is greater in some parts of the country than in others. We publish county-level estimates of the SDIC statistics that enable scholars to assess whether mis-specification in context variables is likely to alter analytic findings when measured at any of the three common Census units.",2018,2018-02-14,7,"{'Nathan Frey', 'Nicholas N.

File Matching with Faulty Continuous Matching Variables,,"We present LFCMV, a Bayesian file linking methodology designed to link records using continuous matching variables in situations where we do not expect values of these matching variables to agree exactly across matched pairs. The method involves a linking model for the distance between the matching variables of records in one file and the matching variables of their linked records in the second. This linking model is conditional on a vector indicating the links. We specify a mixture model for the distance component of the linking model, as this latent structure allows the distance between matching variables in linked pairs to vary across types of linked pairs. Finally, we specify a model for the linking vector. We describe the Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of this linkage model and use artificial data to illustrate model performance.

"The Impact of Chinese Trade on U.S. Employment: The Good, The Bad, and The Apocryphal",,"Using establishment-level micro data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper studies the impact of Chinese import penetration on firm reorganization and relocation across local labor markets. We find three main results. First, the negative effect of Chinese import penetration on local manufacturing employment documented in the existing literature is driven primarily by large, importing firms that simultaneously expand employment in non-manufacturing. A third of this negative manufacturing effect is accounted for by establishments switching their reported industry affiliation to non-manufacturing. Second, the reorganization of firm activity occurs mainly away from production of machinery, electronics, and transportation equipment towards wholesale, professional services (including R&D), and management. Together, the results are indicative of a “Silicone Valley” story of offshoring according to which firms focus U.S. activities on research, design, and distribution but produce the actual goods abroad. Third, the reorganization of firm activity occurs unevenly across local labor markets.

Workersʼ Decisions to Take-Up Offered Health Insurance Coverage: Assessing the Importance of Out-of-Pocket Premium Costs,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200307007-00005,"Background. Many proposed policy initiatives involve subsidies directed toward encouraging employers to offer coverage and toward workers to encourage enrollment in offered plans. Given that insurance coverage reflects employers' decisions to offer coverage, eligibility requirements for such coverage, and employees' take-up decisions, all three elements are important when considering mechanisms to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. Research Design. In this study, we examine the relationship between workers' decisions to take-up offers of health insurance and annual out-of-pocket contributions, total premiums, and employer and workforce characteristics. We model the take-up decision using cross-sectional data from approximately 18,000 establishments per year from the 1997 to 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component. Results. We find that workers are less likely to enroll in coverage as single employee contributions increase. Our results for family contributions are much smaller than for single contributions and are not statistically significant in all years. Our simulation results suggest that reducing employee contribution levels for single coverage from existing levels in 1999 to zero would yield an increase in take-up rates of roughly 6% points in establishments that had required a positive level of contributions. Our results also indicate that of the 13.8 million private sector workers who decline coverage from their employers, 2.5 million would potentially enroll in employer-sponsored coverage if the cost of single coverage were to fall to zero.

Industrial concentration of ethnic minority- and women-owned businesses: evidence from the survey of business owners in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2013.803675,"Using a confidential national survey of ethnic minority- and women-owned businesses in the United States and multivariate regression analyses, this study examines how businesses are concentrated in different industrial sectors across ethnicity and gender, and how the segmentation by the divide of ethnicity and gender is associated with business performance. The findings indicate that male- and female- owned businesses have distinctive industrial concentration patterns. In particular, compared to white women, businesses owned by women from ethnic minority groups are highly concentrated in a limited number of industrial sectors. Concentration in specific industrial sectors does not necessarily mean poor performance when measured by sales, size of employment or payrolls.

Reservation Nonemployer and Employer Establishments: Data from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Databases,,"The presence of businesses on American Indian reservations has been difficult to analyze due to limited data. Akee, Mykerezi, and Todd (AMT; 2017) geocoded confidential data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database to identify whether employer establishments were located on or off American Indian reservations and then compared federally recognized reservations and nearby county areas with respect to their per capita number of employers and jobs. We use their methods and the U.S. Census Integrated Longitudinal Business Database to develop parallel results for nonemployer establishments and for the combination of employer and nonemployer establishments. Similar to AMT’s findings, we find that reservations and nearby county areas have a similar sectoral distribution of nonemployer and nonemployer-plus-employer establishments, but reservations have significantly fewer of them in nearly all sectors, especially when the area population is below 15,000. By contrast to AMT, the average size of reservation nonemployer establishments, as measured by revenue (instead of the jobs measure AMT used for employers), is smaller than the size of nonemployers in nearby county areas, and this is true in most industries as well. The most significant exception is in the retail sector. Geographic and demographic factors, such as population density and per capita income, statistically account for only a small portion of these differences. However, when we assume that nonemployer establishments create the equivalent of one job and use combined employer-plus-nonemployer jobs to measure establishment size, the employer job numbers dominate and we parallel AMT’s finding that, due to large job counts in the Arts/Entertainment/Recreation and Public Administration sectors, reservations on average have slightly more jobs per resident than nearby county areas.",2018,2018-12-01,0,"{'Elton Mykerezi', 'Richard M.

Computationally efficient Bayesian unit-level models for non-Gaussian data under informative sampling with application to estimation of health insurance coverage,https://doi.org/10.1214/21-aoas1524,"Statistical estimates from survey samples have traditionally been obtained via design-based estimators. In many cases these estimators tend to work well for quantities, such as population totals or means, but can fall short as sample sizes become small. In today's ""information age,"" there is a strong demand for more granular estimates. To meet this demand, using a Bayesian pseudolikelihood, we propose a computationally efficient unit-level modeling approach for non-Gaussian data collected under informative sampling designs. Specifically, we focus on binary and multinomial data. Our approach is both multivariate and multiscale, incorporating spatial dependence at the area level. We illustrate our approach through an empirical simulation study and through a motivating application to health insurance estimates, using the American Community Survey.",2022,2022-06-01,7,"{'Ryan Janicki', 'Scott H.

Unit Level Modeling of Survey Data for Small Area Estimation Under Informative Sampling: A Comprehensive Overview with Extensions,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1908.10488,"Model-based small area estimation is frequently used in conjunction with survey data in order to establish estimates for under-sampled or unsampled geographies. These models can be specified at either the area-level, or the unit-level, but unit-level models often offer potential advantages such as more precise estimates and easy spatial aggregation. Nevertheless, relative to area-level models, literature on unit-level models is less prevalent. In modeling small areas at the unit level, challenges often arise as a consequence of the informative sampling mechanism used to collect the survey data. This paper provides a comprehensive methodological review for unit-level models under informative sampling, with an emphasis on Bayesian approaches. To provide insight into the differences between methods, we conduct a simulation study that compares several of the described approaches. In addition, the methods used for simulation are further illustrated through an application to the American Community Survey.

Using county-level data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and broadcast television airings data from the Wesleyan Media Project, we examined the relationship between insurance advertisements and county-level health insurance changes between 2013 and 2014, adjusting for other media and county- and state-level characteristics. We found that counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties. State-sponsored advertisements had the strongest relationship with declines in uninsurance, and this relationship was driven by increases in Medicaid enrollment.

The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23381,"Despite dramatic workforce gains by women in recent decades, a substantial gender earnings gap persists and widens over the course of men's and women's careers.Since there are earnings differences across establishments, a key question is the extent to which the widening of the gender pay gap over time arises from differences in career advances within the same establishment versus differential gains from job-to-job moves across establishments.Using a unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, we find that both channels are important and affect workers differently by education.For the college-educated the increasing gap is for the most part due to differential earnings growth within establishment.The between-establishment component explains only 27 percent of the widening of the total gender pay gap for this group.For workers without college degree, the establishment component is the main driver of the, relatively small, widening of the gender earnings gap.For both education groups, marriage plays a crucial role in the establishment component of the increasing earnings gap.",2017,2017-05-01,27,"{'Claudia Olivetti', 'Erling Barth', 'Sari Pekkala Kerr'}",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Forskning.no (Norway); Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College; Dartmouth College; Forskning.no (Norway); National Bureau of Economic Research; Institute for Social Research; Wellesley College,"Corporate Finance and Governance; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics",,report,Sari Kerr,https://openalex.org/A5003192480,Supplementary Public Data - County Characteristics; Decennial Census,Decennial Census,Boston,594,The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data,100

Bargaining Power in Firm-to-Firm Relationships - Two Methodologies to Detect Outliers in the Census Trade Data,,"This note develops two methodologies to detect possibly incorrectly reported shipment values and quantities in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). Both approaches seek to identify outliers in terms of unit values, defined as the ratio of value and quantity shipped. The first methodology examines trades in the far tails of the cross-sectional unit value distribution across importers or exporters, and highlights those trades that appear incompatible with a given U.S. firm's own transactions. The second approach identifies outliers as cases where a unit value jumps by an order of magnitude compared to a U.S. firm's transactions over the past two years. While both approaches reveal that outliers are relatively rare, the note highlights several cases where outliers were very large and possibly affected trade statistics. The note further presents distributions of outliers by value and discusses the countries and products that exhibit the largest shares of outliers. It also presents a number of examples to showcase that outliers identified by the two methodologies appear suspicious also to a human looking at the data. The note concludes with a discussion of the advantages and the disadvantages of the two approaches. The code files referenced in this file are available to Census employees and will hopefully be of use going forward.",2017,2017-01-01,0,{'Sebastian Heise'},,Global trade and economics; Global Trade and Competitiveness; Census and Population Estimation,,article,Sebastian Heise,https://openalex.org/A5052207549,Census of Mining; Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database; American Community Survey,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,Baruch,1053,Bargaining Power in Firm-to-Firm Relationships - ‎Two Methodologies to Detect Outliers in the Census Trade Data,100
Who are the people in my neighborhood?: The 'contextual fallacy' of measuring individual context with census geographies,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,"Scholars deploy census-based measures of neighborhood context throughout the social sciences and epidemiology. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy-a measure of ethno-racial diversity), we find that block-level Census statistics frequently do not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales. Finally, we show that within-unit variation is greater in some parts of the country than in others. We publish county-level estimates of the SDIC statistics that enable scholars to assess whether mis-specification in context variables is likely to alter analytic findings when measured at any of the three common Census units.",2018,2018-02-14,7,"{'Nathan Frey', 'Nicholas N.

The results are presented in the form of summary tables showing the total number of firms, number of outliers per industry sector and percentage of outliers per industry sector.

The Impacts of Opportunity Zones on Zone Residents,,"Created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, the Opportunity Zone program was designed to encourage investment in distressed communities across the U.S. We examine the early impacts of the Opportunity Zone program on residents of targeted areas. We leverage restricted-access microdata from the American Community Survey and employ difference-in-differences and matching approaches to estimate causal reduced-form effects of the program.

Preliminary Analysis of the Distributions of Carbon and Energy Intensity for 27 Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industrial Sectors,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1925133,"It is well documented that different manufacturing sectors require different amounts of energy. Primary materials conversion, e.g., iron ore and scrap into steel, limestone and sand into cement and glass, or wood and other fibers into paper, tend to be the most energy-intensive in the production process, while final consumer products like electronics and clothing require the least energy. This leads to something like the 80-20 rule, where a large portion of energy use is in a small number of industries. For example, the 2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) reported that 75 percent of fuel use arises from only five of the 21 three-digit industries, using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These five sectors are a small share of the total U.S. economy. The energy intensity for different industrial sectors is easily measured using published government statistics, but the plants within these industries are not homogeneous entities.

Examples of such manufacturing-like companies include Apple, Mindspeed Technologies (a fabless semiconductor company), and the British appliance firm Dyson. They take a product from concept through production and delivery but do not actually engage in the production themselves. There exists little evidence to date about the importance of these kinds of enterprises and the chapter is particularly timely as beginning in 2017 the US Census Bureau will move FGP establishments to manufacturing. This reclassification of FGPs would have increased the number of US manufacturing employees in 2007 by a minimum of 431,000 to a maximum of 1,934,000, an increase of between 3% and 14%.",2017,2017-03-16,5,"{'Teresa Fort', 'Andrew B.

Task Trade and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,,"Do job characteristics modulate the relationship between import competition and the wages of workers who perform those jobs? This paper tests the claim that workers in occupations featuring highly routine tasks will be more vulnerable to low-wage country import competition. Using data from the US Census Bureau, we construct a pooled cross-section (1990, 2000, and 2007) of more than 1.6 million individuals linked to the establishment in which they work. Occupational measures of vulnerability to trade competition – routineness, analytic complexity, and interpersonal interaction on the job – are constructed using O*NET data. The linked employer-employee data allow us to model the effect of low-wage import competition on the wages of workers with different occupational characteristics. Our results show that low-wage country import competition is associated with lower wages for US workers holding jobs that are highly routine and less complex. For workers holding nonroutine and highly complex jobs, increased import competition is associated with higher wages. Finally, workers in occupations with the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal interaction see higher wages, while workers with medium-low levels of interpersonal interaction suffer lower wages with increased low-wage import competition. These findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for occupational characteristics to more fully understand the relationship between trade and wages, and suggest ways in which task trade vulnerable occupations can disadvantage workers even when their jobs remain onshore.",2016,2016-01-01,0,"{'Thomas Kemeny', 'Abigail M.

"Taxation, Corruption, and Growth",,"We build an endogenous growth model to analyze the relationships between taxation, corruption, and economic growth. Entrepreneurs lie at the center of the model and face disincentive effects from taxation but acquire positive benefits from public infrastructure. Political corruption governs the efficiency with which tax revenues are translated into infrastructure. The model predicts an inverted-U relationship between taxation and growth, with corruption reducing the optimal taxation level. We find evidence consistent with these predictions and the entrepreneurial channel using data from the Longitudinal Business Database of the US Census Bureau. The marginal effect of taxation for growth for a state at the 10th or 25th percentile of corruption is significantly positive; on the other hand, the marginal effects of taxation for growth for a state at the 90th percentile of corruption are much lower across the board. We make progress towards causality through Granger-style tests and by considering periphery counties where effective tax policy is largely driven by bordering states. Finally, we calibrate our model and find that the calibrated taxation rate of 37% is fairly close to the model׳s estimated welfare maximizing taxation rate of 42%. Reducing corruption provides the largest potential impact for welfare gain through its impact on the uses of tax revenues.",2016,2016-07-01,9,"{'Philippe Aghion', 'Ufuk Akcigit', 'William R.

"Public versus Private Firms: Energy Efficiency, Toxic Emissions, and Abatement Spending",https://doi.org/10.1108/s0742-332220180000038006,"We examine the effect of firm ownership status on three environmentally relevant variables: energy efficiency, toxic emissions, and spending on pollution abatement. Prior research has demonstrated that public firms invest less than private firms and suggests this difference is due pressure from investors to strongly favor short over long-term earnings. We extend this logic to other firm behavior, examining whether publicly owned facilities invest in energy efficiency and pollution reduction differently than privately owned facilities. Using data from the US Census of Manufactures from 1980 to 2009, information on pollution from the Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and pollution abatement spending from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey, we find that facilities switching to public ownership are less energy efficient and spend less on pollution abatement than their privately owned counterparts. However, we also find that facilities switching to public ownership have lower toxic emissions than other facilities. We also examine how different sources of external pressures alter these results and find that increased regulatory scrutiny is correlated with increased energy efficiency, toxic emissions, and abatement spending. More concentrated institutional ownership in public firms is associated with lower energy efficiency as is a greater brand focus. These latter results are broadly consistent with the idea that publicly owned firms respond to pressures from investors with a reduced focus on environmentally relevant variables. However, since facilities switching to public ownership have lower toxic emissions, this suggests that there are two competing pressures in publicly owned facilities: cost pressures, consistent with lowered energy efficiency, and public perceptions, consistent with lower toxic emissions, particularly since TRI data became available.

Offshoring Pollution while Offshoring Production?,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2656,"Research summary: We examine the role of firm strategy in the global effort to combat pollution. We find that U.S. plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). Consistent with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, goods imported by U.S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries. U.S. plants shift production to less pollution-intensive industries, produce less waste, and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from LWCs. The negative impact of LWC imports on emissions is stronger for U.S. plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance, but weaker for more-capable U.S. plants and firms. These results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capability in explaining firms' offshoring and environmental strategies. Managerial summary: Using confidential trade, production, and pollution data of more than 8,000 firms and 18,000 plants from the U.S. Census Bureau for years 1992–2009, we find that U.S. plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). In addition, goods imported by U.S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries. U.S. plants shift production to less pollution-intensive industries, produce less waste, and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from LWCs. However, not all U.S. firms choose to ""offshore pollution.""

In addition, firms that import more from LWCs release less toxic emissions and spend less on pollution abatement in the US.

Spatial Organization of Firms: The Decision to Split Production and Administration,,"A firm’s production activities are often supported by non-production activities. Among these activities are administrative units including headquarters, which process information both within and between firms. Often firms physically separate such administrative units from their production activities and create stand alone Central Administrative Offices (CAO). However, having its activities in multiple locations potentially imposes significant internal firm face-to-face communication costs. What types of firms are more likely to separate out such functions? If firms do separate administration and production, where do they place CAOs and why? How often do firms open and close, or relocate CAOs? This paper documents such firms’ decisions on their spatial organization by using micro-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",2004,2004-02-01,2,"{'Yukako Ono', 'Kristin Aarland', 'J.
